  <p>[Project Track] Street-level semantic segmentation is a core capability for autonomous driving systems, yet performance is often dominated by severe class imbalance where large categories such as roads and skies overwhelm safety-critical but rare classes like bikes, motorcycles, and poles. Using the BDD100K dataset, this study systematically examines how architectural choices, loss design, and training strategies affect segmentation quality beyond misleading pixel-level accuracy. Starting from a DeepLabV3-ResNet50 baseline, we demonstrate that high pixel accuracy (~ 94%) can coincide with extremely poor mIoU (~ 4%) under imbalance. We then introduce class-weighted and combined Dice-Cross-Entropy/Focal losses, auxiliary supervision, differential learning rates, and gradient clipping, achieving a 10x improvement in mIoU. Then, we propose a targeted optimization strategy that remaps the task to six safety-critical small classes and leverages higher resolution, aggressive augmentation, and boosted class weights for thin and small objects. This approach significantly improves IoU for bicycles, motorcycles, and poles, highlighting practical trade-offs between accuracy, resolution, and computational cost. However, such increases in resolution resulted in significant increases to training time per epoch, resulting in less training. Our last contribution is a boundary-aware auxillary supervision strategy that explicitly promotes boundary preservation for thin and small objects while maintaining architectural simplicity. Overall, the work provides an empirically grounded blueprint for addressing class imbalance and small-object segmentation in urban scene understanding.</p>

<h1 id="streetview-semantics">Streetview Semantics</h1>

<h2 id="what-is-streetview-semantics">What is streetview semantics?</h2>

<p>Streetview semantics involves assigning meaningful labels such as <em>road</em>, <em>sidewalk</em>, <em>building</em>, <em>vehicle</em>, <em>pedestrian</em>, or <em>sky</em> to pixels or regions in images captured from a street-level perspective.</p>

<p>Semantic segmentation of streetview images can be used to transform raw visual input into a structured representation, where each region corresponds to an object or surface with a specific functional role. This semantic understanding enables higher-level reasoning about the environment, such as identifying drivable areas, detecting obstacles, and interpreting relationships between objects in down stream tasks, like autonomus driving.</p>

<h2 id="dataset">Dataset</h2>

<p>The BDD100K dataset [2] includes a diverse collection of streetview images designed for autonomus driving research. The dataset includes images captured by a camera mounted on a vehicle from a variety of locations like New York and San Francisco.</p>

<p>We use 10,000 images and their semantically segmented labeled masks to train and test our model.</p>

<p><strong>Table 1:</strong> Pixel distribution across semantic classes in the dataset.</p>

<p>The BDD100K dataset exhibits severe class imbalance, with a small number of large classes; most notably road, vegetation, and sky-dominating pixel coverage, while many semantically and operationally important classes occupy only a minimal fraction of the image area. This imbalance induces a common failure mode in semantic segmentation, whereby models achieve high pixel-level accuracy by overpredicting majority classes while largely ignoring rare objects. Such behavior is particularly problematic in autonomous driving contexts, where small and thin objects such as bicycles and poles are both visually challenging and safety-critical. Accordingly, our objective is not to optimize global accuracy, but to improve the reliable detection and segmentation of minority classes relative to a baseline, even when this entails trade-offs on dominant classes.</p>

<h2 id="initial-baseline-implementation">Initial baseline implementation</h2>

<p>We first started with simply feeding our test set to DeepLabV3 [1] with a ResNet-50 Backbone [5].</p>

<p>We chose this model for its proven performance on urban scene understanding (Cityscapes [6], COCO), its Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module for multi-scale context, pretrained ResNet-50 backbone for strong feature representations, and auxiliary classifier head for improved gradient flow.</p>

<p>Our initial model performed deceptively well (when it was in fact not performant at all) because we used pixel-level accuracy as our metric. When checking model predictions on the test set, we can see the model is not performing well:</p>

<p><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/44/badseg.png" alt="Bad segmentation from the old model" /></p>

<p><strong>High pixel accuracy</strong>: ~ 93%</p>

<p><strong>Very poor mIoU</strong>: ~ 4%</p>

<p>This was likely caused by a severe class imbalance in the BDD100K dataset. The model learns to predict only common classes, causing high pixel accuracy but poor mIoU.</p>

<h2 id="improvements-atop-baseline-model">Improvements atop Baseline Model</h2>

<p>We implemented a variety of additions to our baseline model in hopes of pushing the model to classify low-density classes more.</p>

<h3 id="1-class-weighting">1. <strong>Class Weighting</strong></h3>

<p>We assign higher weight to rarer classes (less pixels labeled in pictures in the dataset) in our loss function in order to get our model to focus on these fine grained details. This prevents the model from straight out ignoring minority classes and simply labeling majority classes to everything. This works as a sort of increased penalty for cheating.</p>

<p>We assign inverse-frequency weight for class \(f_c\) and normalize.</p>

\[w_c = \frac{\frac{1}{f_cC}}{\sum_{i=1}^C w_i}C\]

<h3 id="2-combined-loss-function">2. <strong>Combined Loss Function</strong></h3>

<p>We use a combined <strong>Dice loss</strong> and <strong>Cross Entropy loss</strong> to better handle the class imbalance and improve boundary predictions.</p>

<p>Dice loss is defined as:</p>

\[{L}_{d} =1 - \frac{2\sum_{i=1}^n y_{pred_i}y_{true_i} + \epsilon}{\sum_{i=1}^n y_{pred_i} + \sum_{i=1}^n y_{true_i} + \epsilon}\]

<p>Cross Entropy loss is defined as:</p>

\[{L}_{CE} = -\sum_{c=1}^N y_clog(p_i)\]

<p>The combined loss is simply</p>

\[{L} = {L}_{d} + {L}_{CE}\]

<p>This creates a training objective that balances per-pixel classification accuracy and region level overlap, encouraging accurate semantic prediction.</p>

<h3 id="3-auxiliary-loss-usage">3. <strong>Auxiliary Loss Usage</strong></h3>

<p>We make use of the two predictions the network produces: full-resolution prediction and the intermediate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aux_out</code> prediction from an earlier layer. This helps our deep network’s gradients have a shorter path to reach earlier layers.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>We reduce the learning rate of the pretrained backbone and increase it for the classifier head to allow for better retainment of high-level vision understanding while better learning our dataset.</p>

<h3 id="5-gradient-clipping">5. <strong>Gradient Clipping</strong></h3>

<p>We clip gradients to a max norm of 1 to prevent exploding gradients. This allows for more stable training.</p>

\[g_i \leftarrow g_i \frac{1}{||\textbf{g}||_2}\]

<h2 id="further-model-development">Further Model Development</h2>

<p>The initial results of running our model through 6400 training samples on 9 epochs produced best model at the 9th epoch with validation mIoU (on 1600 test samples) of <strong>41.56%</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/44/mv1_training.png" alt="Training" />
<em>Note that the Epoch axies are wrong here; we trained 4 extra epochs after it was already trained for 5.</em></p>

<p>This shows promising improvement over our baseline. Looking at some model sample outputs, we see the model is able to identify large segments but struggles to match a precise boundary.</p>

<p><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/44/okseg.png" alt="Some samples" /></p>

<p>mIoU: 0.4156</p>

<p>In order to test whether our model can effectively differentiate difficult classes, however, we decided to repeat the same training setup using a modified dataset. In this variant, all classes are assigned a weight of 0 except for <em>pole, vegetation, person, car, motorcycle,</em> and <em>bicycle</em>. These classes are suspected to be especially difficult to segment due to their low frequency in the dataset and, for some, their thin or fine-grained structure.</p>

<p>The resulting model performed <strong>significantly worse overall</strong>, with particularly poor performance on thin objects such as <strong>poles</strong>, <strong>motorcycles</strong>, and <strong>bicycles</strong> with individual IoUs of less than 0.001 and an overall mIoU of 25%.</p>

<p>This collapse in our first 6-class attempt pushed us to design a third version: moving to 1024 x 512 resolution, stronger Focal Loss [3] focus (y = 3.0), heavier class weights (bike/moto 3x, pole 2x), wider scale augmentation (0.5 - 2.0), tighter crops (0.6 - 1.0) to keep small objects in frame, and light random erasing to cut background reliance. The combined Focal Loss [3] and Dice Loss [4] formulation helped target hard examples and improve boundary predictions for thin objects. The goal was to recover and improve thin-object performance, especially for bicycles and motorcycles, while staying focused on the six safety-critical classes. However, these improvements, especially the increase in resolution did lead to a significant increase in training time (one hour per epoch) as we would need to half the batch size.</p>

<p>After 10 epochs with the improved v3 setup, the 6-class evaluation produced the following class-wise weights and IoU scores:</p>

</table>

<p>mIoU: 0.3592</p>

<p>Although our overall mIoU was still lower than our model for all classes, it still showed significant improvement as not only were pole and bicycle able to break the 0.01 value of IoU, motorcycle improved drastically , reaching an IoU of 0.25. However we do believe that further training could generate even stronger results.</p>

<h2 id="boundary">Boundary-Aware Auxiliary Supervision</h2>

<p>Recent research has proposed incorporating explicit boundary or edge information into semantic segmentation models. The motivation behind these approaches is that by introducing an auxiliary task that supervises object boundaries, the model can learn finer-grained spatial features that improve the distinction between adjacent objects.</p>

<h3 id="related-work">Related Work</h3>

<p>We draw inspiration from <strong>Takikawa et al.</strong>, who proposed <strong>Gated-SCNN: Gated Shape CNNs for Semantic Segmentation (ICCV 2019)</strong> [6]. Their work demonstrates that incorporating boundary and shape prediction objectives significantly improves both mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) and boundary F-score, with particularly strong gains for thin and small objects. While effective, this approach requires substantial architectural changes and increased computational cost, as it introduces a two-stream CNN architecture.</p>

<h3 id="our-design">Our Design</h3>

<p>In our work, we adopt <strong>explicit boundary supervision as an auxiliary task</strong>. Rather than modifying the core architecture, we augment the model with a lightweight boundary prediction head and an additional loss term during training. Boundary labels are generated directly from the ground-truth segmentation masks, requiring no additional annotations. A pixel is labeled as a boundary pixel if any of its 4-connected neighbors belongs to a different semantic class (excluding ignore regions). This produces a binary boundary map in which pixels on class transitions are marked as 1, and all other pixels are marked as 0. This process is deterministic, computationally inexpensive, and ensures perfect alignment between segmentation and boundary targets.</p>

<p>To incorporate boundary supervision into the model, we attach a small boundary prediction head to the shared feature representation produced by the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module. Specifically, a 1×1 convolutional layer is added on top of the ASPP features to predict a single-channel boundary logit map. The segmentation head and boundary head share all upstream features, enabling multi-task learning without duplicating computation. Importantly, the DeepLabv3 backbone and ASPP remain unchanged. To avoid modifying the model’s output interface, ASPP features are accessed via a forward hook, preserving the original training and evaluation pipeline.</p>

<p>This design was chosen to balance effectiveness and simplicity. Attaching the boundary head at the ASPP level allows the auxiliary task to operate on high-level semantic features while still retaining sufficient spatial resolution for boundary localization. In contrast, attaching boundary supervision earlier in the backbone would emphasize low-level edge detection but was found to produce noisier boundary predictions that did not align well with semantic class transitions. Using a lightweight 1×1 convolution further minimizes additional parameters, reducing the risk of overfitting and ensuring that performance gains arise from improved supervision rather than increased model capacity.</p>

<h3 id="loss-function">Loss Function</h3>

<p>The total training objective is defined as:</p>

<p>\[
L = L_{\text{seg}} + \lambda L_{\text{boundary}}
\]</p>

<p>Here, L_seg denotes the primary segmentation loss from before, implemented as a combination of focal loss and Dice loss to address class imbalance and improve region-level overlap. The boundary loss L_boundary is defined as a binary cross-entropy loss with logits, applied only to valid (non-ignore) pixels and computed from boundary targets derived from ground-truth segmentation masks. The scalar weight lambda controls the relative contribution of boundary supervision and is set to 0.2. Empirically, we found that this weighting provides a good trade-off between encouraging precise boundary localization and maintaining region-level semantic consistency. Larger values of lambda tended to overemphasize fine-grained edges at the expense of interior region accuracy, while smaller values diminished the impact of the auxiliary task.</p>

<p>The boundary-aware model improves overall performance, increasing mIoU from <strong>0.3592</strong> (DeepLabv3 baseline) to <strong>0.3817</strong>. The largest gains occur for boundary-sensitive classes, most notably <strong>pole</strong>, which improves from <strong>0.0105</strong> to <strong>0.2958</strong>, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit boundary supervision for thin structures. Improvements are also observed for <strong>vegetation</strong> (0.6153 → 0.7590), <strong>car</strong> (0.7371 → 0.8043), and <strong>person</strong> (0.4454 → 0.4829). Note that our additions seemed to improve for large objects as well,</p>

<p>Performance on <strong>motorcycle</strong> remains largely unchanged, while <strong>bicycle</strong> exhibits a decrease in IoU. This suggests that although boundary supervision improves localization, it may overemphasize edges for extremely sparse objects without sufficiently reinforcing interior regions. Overall, these results validate boundary-aware auxiliary supervision as an effective and lightweight improvement over the baseline, particularly for thin and boundary-sensitive classes.</p>

<p>As future work, more experimentation would be necessary to evaluate how our boundary-aware auxiliary supervision improves all class IoUs or fine-grained structures disproportionately. Additionally, exploring complementary approaches such as region-consistency losses, shape-aware architectures, or post-processing refinement methods may further improve performance on challenging small and thin object classes.</p>

<h2 id="future-uses">Future uses</h2>

<p>Beyond standard IoU metrics, we implemented a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RoadSafetyAnalyzer</code> class in our notebook that computes a composite safety score (0 - 100) based on segmentation predictions. This scorer evaluates road visibility, pedestrian and vehicle presence, obstacle detection, and lane clarity to provide a risk-level assessment (LOW, MODERATE, HIGH, CRITICAL) for each scene.</p>

<p><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/44/safety_comparison.png" alt="Best and worst safety scores" /></p>

<p>Future work could extend this framework to temporal analysis across video sequences, multi-sensor fusion, and adaptive policy generation based on safety scores.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This work demonstrates that semantic segmentation performance in urban driving scenes cannot be meaningfully assessed, or improved, using pixel-level accuracy alone in the presence of extreme class imbalance. Through a series of controlled model iterations on the BDD100K dataset, we show that loss design, class-aware weighting, and training strategy play a decisive role in recovering minority-class performance. By progressively shifting from a general-purpose baseline to a targeted, high-resolution optimization focused on safety-critical classes, and explicitly encouraging boundary preservation, we achieve substantial gains in mIoU and per-class IoU for thin and rare objects such as poles and other fine-grained structures. These results highlight the necessity of task and risk-aware model design in autonomous driving and provide a practical blueprint for addressing imbalance-driven failure modes without reliance on dataset expansion.</p>

<h2 id="background-and-introduction">Background and Introduction</h2>

<p>Super-resolution is a natural problem for image-to-image methods in computer vision, referring to the process of using a degraded, downsampled image to recover the original image before degradation and downsampling. Of course, this is an ill-posed problem; two different high-resolution images can downsample and degrade into the same low-resolution image (that is, the process is not injective), so truly inverting the process is impossible. For this reason, we settle for the task of estimating a function that approximates an inverse, producing a high-resolution image based solely on some mathematical assumptions and the information of the low-resolution image. This includes simple, classical methods, such as nearest-neighbor or bicubic upsampling, as well as, in recent years, statistical methods making use of deep learning for computer vision.</p>

<p>We will be surveying three of these recent methods, highlighting the very different ways that one can go about achieving the same end goal in super-resolution:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT), a shifted-window Transformer-based method</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Look-Up Table (LUT) methods, which use a precomputed table of pixel estimates</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfolding networks, which combine classical model-based methods with learning-based methods</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, we will be discussing an experiment that we carried out involving a modification to the HAT architecture.</p>

<h3 id="hybrid-attention-transformer-hat">Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT)</h3>

<p>Transformer-based models have recently seen great success for vision tasks, with modifications such as the Swin Transformer further improving these models by reducing computational burdens and reintroducing inductive biases. However, in practice, Swin-based methods often suffer from a small practical receptive field, where the reconstruction prediction of any given pixel is based only upon a small number of pixels near it, even if, in theory, the tokens for that part of the image should have implicitly “seen” all other tokens during self-attention. For this, the Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT) is designed specifically to utilize a larger portion of the image during reconstruction by combining windowed-self-attention, channel attention, and a novel overlapping-window attention mechanism.</p>

<p style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/HAT_architecture.png" alt="HAT architecture" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 1. HAT Architecture Overview [1].</em></p>

<h4 id="hybrid-attention-block-hab">Hybrid Attention Block (HAB)</h4>

<p style="max-width: 70%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/hab.png" alt="hybrid attention block" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 2. Hybrid Attention Block [1].</em></p>

<p>The Hybrid Attention Block (HAB) aims to combine the deep flexibility of Vision Transformers with the efficiency and global accessibility of channel attention.</p>

<p style="max-width: 70%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/cab.png" alt="channel attention block" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 3. Channel Attention Block [1].</em></p>

<p>The Channel Attention Block (CAB) consists of two convolutional layers separated by a GELU activation, followed by a channel attention (CA) module. The CA module consists of global average pooling (GAP), followed by two \(1 \times 1\) convolutions, ensuring that the channel number is the same as prior to the CA module, separated by another GELU. Then, the sigmoid function is applied to the now-\(1 \times 1 \times C\)-shaped output to create channel weights, which are multiplied channel-wise by the pre-CA module input, to get an output of the same \(H \times W \times C\) shape, where each channel has been scaled by a factor in \([0, 1]\). The factors are applied globally to each channel and are determined by GAP + convolutions, allowing all channels to utilize information from, to some degree, all positions in all other channels in an efficient manner.</p>

<p>In the HAB, the CAB is inserted into a standard Swin Transformer block after the first LayerNorm in parallel with the window-based multi-head self-attention (W-MSA) module, where they are then combined additively (along with a residual connection). The efficiency and simplicity of the CAB comes at the cost of specific positional information being unutilized due to GAP, which is why the CAB is used in parallel with W-MSA, which explicitly <em>does</em> account for positional information. So, then, for a given input feature \(X\), the HAB is computed as:</p>

\[X_N = \mathrm{LN}(X),\]

\[X_M = (\text{S})\text{W-MSA}(X_N) + \alpha\,\mathrm{CAB}(X_N) + X\]

\[Y = \mathrm{MLP}(\mathrm{LN}(X_M)) + X_M,\]

<p>where LN is the LayerNorm, (S)W-MSA is the (shifted) window-multihead self attention, MLP is the standard positionwise feed-forward network of a Transformer, \(X_N\) and \(X_M\) denote intermediate features, \(Y\) is the output, and \(\alpha\) is a small hyperparameter that tempers the influence of the CAB compared to the W-MSA, to avoid issues of conflict between the two modules during optimization; empirically, \(\alpha=0.01\) was found to give the best performance, as this parallel scheme can introduce significant stability issues in the optimization process if the influence of each branch is not controlled. Within-window linear mappings are used to get \(Q\), \(K\), and \(V\) matrices, though, notably, these mappings are applied on the individual spatial pixels of the input, not on patches (that is, patches of size \(1 \times 1\) are used), as the spatial dimensions of the input need to be maintained throughout the network to account for residual connections. A fixed window size is employed, the same as in the regular Swin Transformer, however, notably, the model does not contain any patch merging, again in service of retaining the shape of the image for residual connections. Within-window attention uses the standard attention scheme, with a fixed sinusoidal relative positional encoding within each window similar to that of “Attention is All You Need”.</p>

<h4 id="overlapping-cross-attention-block-ocab">Overlapping Cross-Attention Block (OCAB)</h4>

<p style="max-width: 80%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/overlapping.png" alt="Overlapping window partition" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 4. The overlapping window partition for OCA [1].</em></p>

<p>OCAB modules are used throughout the HAT to further allow for cross-window connections; the basic idea is that windowed self-attention is performed on the input as normal, in the exact same manner as in the HAB module, though the windows for the keys and values, while still centered on the same locations as the windows of the queries, are larger than those of the queries, allowing each window to pull in some information from neighboring windows that it normally would not see.</p>

<p>Specifically, for input features \(X\), let \(X_Q, X_K, X_V \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times C}\). \(X_Q\) is partitioned into \(\frac{HW}{M^2}\) non-overlapping windows of size \(M \times M\). \(X_K\) and \(X_V\) are partitioned into \(\frac{HW}{M^2}\) overlapping windows of size \(M_o\times M_o\), where \(M_o\) is calculated as</p>

\[M_o = (1 + \gamma)M,\]

<p>where \(\gamma\) is a hyperparameter introduced in order to control the size of the overlapping windows, and the input is zero-padded to account for this larger window. Aside from shifting windows, this allows for even more cross-window information transmission, as each query window, which are the standard size, can pull in information from the key and value windows that include the query window and extend into the space that would otherwise be a separate, independent window. OCAB is specifically designed to mitigate the blocking artifacts that the standard Swin Transformer produces:</p>

<p style="max-width: 80%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/blocking.png" alt="Blocking " /></p>
<p><em>Fig 5. Comparison of blocking between SwinIR and HAT [1].</em></p>

<p>The OCAB combats this by directly stepping over the hard boundaries between windows, reducing their presence in the extracted features; each query window has access to information about the space beyond its own boundaries, so they can better create smooth boundaries in the features between adjacent windows. While standard window shifting has a similar goal, each shifted window still only has access to its own pixels, which may still lead to hard boundaries and blocking between windows that become present in the features.</p>

<p>Empirically, \(\gamma=0.5\) was found to give the best performance, translating to overlapping windows that are, by area, 4/9 composed of the original window and 5/9 composed of adjacent windows. This is less extreme than the shifted windows of the standard Swin Transformer, where, since the regular shifting amount is half of the window size in each dimension, shifted windows are only 1/4 composed of their original window, and are 3/4 composed of other windows. Still, this additional method of cross-window attention gives the model greater flexibility and another opportunity to use a larger portion of the original image in its reconstruction process.</p>

<h4 id="residual-hybrid-attention-group-rhag">Residual Hybrid Attention Group (RHAG)</h4>

<p style="max-width: 70%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/rhag.png" alt="Residual Hybrid Attention Group" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 6. The structure of a Residual Hybrid Attention Group [1].</em></p>

<p>These modules are combined in a further modular format via a Residual Hybrid Attention Group (RHAG), which puts a variable number of HAB modules in sequence which are followed by an OCAB module, with a final convolutional layer to ensure compatability between shapes of the input and output that allows for a residual connection over the entire module. The sequencing of HAB modules mirrors the structure of standard Swin stages, as the attention windows are shifted between subsequent HABs; though, patch merging is skipped in favor of the OCABs, as they both aim to combine information between windows, and OCAB can retain the spatial size of the input.</p>

<h4 id="high-level-model-structure">High-Level Model Structure</h4>

<p style="max-width: 80%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/highlevelhat.png" alt="High Level HAT" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 7. The high-level structure of the HAT [1].</em></p>

<p>Contrary to the standard Swin, projection to the desired channel dimension is done using an initial convolutional layer; though, mirroring the structure of the Swin Transformer, multiple RHAG modules are placed in sequence (similar to the sequence of stages in Swin), though in this case, a residual connection (along with a convolutional layer to ensure compatability of shapes) is employed across the series of RHAGs. Then, the final image reconstruction is performed using convolutions (for channel number adjustments) and pixel shuffle, where pixels from many channels are pulled together sequentially into a smaller number of channels with a larger image size.</p>

<h4 id="results">Results</h4>

<p style="max-width: 80%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/lam.png" alt="LAM Results" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 8. LAM results for different SR methods [1].</em></p>

<p>In practice, the HAT does, indeed, use a larger portion of the input image for reconstruction than other Transformer-based SR methods. Above is a comparison of Local Attribution Maps (LAM) between different models, which is a method for measuring which portions of the input were most influential for a given patch of the output. We see that HAT is highly nonlocal compared to other methods in terms of LAM, and performs better for it.</p>

<p style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/quantitativeresultshat.png" alt="Quantitative Results" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 9. Quantitative results for HAT compared to other methods [1].</em></p>

<p>The authors compared 3 versions of the model: HAT-S, HAT, and HAT-L: HAT has a similar size to the existing Swin super-resolution model SwinIR, with 6 RHAG modules with 6 HABs each; HAT-L is larger than HAT, with 12 RHAGs instead of 6; HAT-S is smaller than HAT, utilizing only depthwise convolutions and featuring a smaller channel number throughout the model, resulting in overall computation similar to that of SwinIR. Quantitatively, in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM), two standard metrics for image reconstruction, HAT’s variants outperform their peers (if only slightly), and larger HAT models tend to yield better performance (again, if only slightly).</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>The HAT is a notable modification of the Swin Transformer architecture, designed for super resolution, due to its large practical receptive field; while all SR methods have an entire image to work with as input, it takes effort and specific design to actually use the information that is there in an efficient manner, which can be crucial to reconstructing an image correctly. Judging by its quantitative results, the future state-of-the-art in SR will likely be driven, to some degree, by the development of methods that are designed to produce even larger receptive fields. However, due to the large, Transformer-based architecture, despite using the Swin Transformer, the larger HAT variants can be computationally demanding; while the results are favorable, further developments may be required to make a model like this practical.</p>

<h3 id="look-up-table-lut-methods">Look-Up Table (LUT) Methods</h3>

<p>There have been relatively few attempts to make modern deep learning-based methods of super-resolution computationally efficient enough for common consumer applications such as cameras, mobile phones, and televisions. Look-Up Table (LUT) methods, as described in [3], aim to bridge this gap by using a precomputed LUT, where the output values from a deep SR network are stored in advance; during inference, the system can quickly retrieve these high-resolution values by querying the LUT with low-resolution input pixels.</p>

<p style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/lut_architecture.png" alt="LUT architecture" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 10. LUT Method Overview [3].</em></p>

<h4 id="the-lut">The LUT</h4>

<p>It may be useful to start with how the LUT will be used in inference: given a low-resolution image and an upscaling factor \(r\), our goal is will be to map each pixel of the low-res image to an image patch of size \(r \times r\), which we then assemble into a full upscaled image. This process will be done independently for each color channel, so that we are assembling 3 independent images with 1 color channel each and then concatenating them to form a 3-channel image. For a given image pixel at location \((i, j)\), we would like this mapping to take into account the pixels surrounding \((i, j)\) as well as the pixel itself; so, to get the patch for pixel \((i, j)\), the LUT will be indexed by a fixed number of pixel values surrounding \((i, j)\) (given that we use pixel values for indexing, we use 8-bit color), and at this index in the LUT, there will be \(r^2\) values that we can use to construct an image patch. For instance, for \(r=2\) and a LUT receptive field of 4, let 
\(I_0 = image[i, j], I_1 = image[i+1, j], I_2 = image[i, j+1], I_3 = image[i+1, j+1]\). 
Then, \(LUT[I_0][I_1][I_2][I_3][0][0]\) will contain the top-left corner of the upscaled patch, and \(LUT[I_0][I_1][I_2][I_3][1][1]\) will contain the bottom-right corner. This will be the basic method that the LUT uses in inference, which only requires table lookup, and no network computation.</p>

<h4 id="the-sr-network">The SR Network</h4>

<p>Now, with a clear goal of how the LUT should function, we can construct the network that will give us its values. Given that we want the patch in the LUT for each specific pixel value to depend solely on a fixed number of surrounding pixels, a convolutional network with a finely-controlled receptive field seems natural; again, note that the LUT upscaling process is performed independently on each color channel, so the input to this network will only have 1 channel. Specifically, given a receptive field size \(n\) and an upscaling factor \(r\), we can construct a network as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a series of convolutional layers (with nonlinearities), where, at the end, each output pixel has a gross receptive field of size \(n\) and the output has \(r^2\) channels</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a pixel shuffle that will construct upscaled patches from our channels and concatenate them together into a full upscaled image</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>with this, we have constructed a network where each tiled \(r \times r\) patch of the output depends only on a (contiguous) size \(n\) receptive field from the input. Now, if we optimize this network for super-resolution, to construct our LUT, we can simply generate patches of size \(n\) with specific values (which will be indexes in the LUT) and feed them into the network, and the resulting upscaled patch can be added to the LUT at the given index. The kernels of the convolutional layers could be anything as long as it conforms to the receptive field requirement, however, the authors of the paper use an architecture where the first convolutional layer results in a receptive field of size \(n\), and all subsequent layers are \(1\times 1\) convolutions (the issue of the kernel reducing the size of the input is dealt with by pre-padding the image); additionally, they use a square kernel when possible, as it will capture the pixels that are most adjacent, and thus most relevant, to each other, compared to a non-square kernel.</p>

<p>Of course, the principal design priority of the LUT is efficiency in speed and size. Using 8-bit color, if we construct a LUT that accounts for every possible input patch, one can compute the size of the LUT for a given receptive field \(n\) and upscale factor \(r\) as</p>

\[(2^8)^n r^2 \text{ bytes}\]

<p>This can be seen clearly from the structure of the LUT; there are \(2^8\) possible values for a given 1-channel pixel (again, for 8-bit color), so for a RF of size \(n\), there are \((2^8)^n\) possible input patches. At each index corresponding to an input patch, there is an upscaled patch of size \(r^2\), whose entries are also each 8 bits (or 1 byte). Clearly, this will not scale well with \(n\), and in fact, \(n=4\) and \(r=2\) gives us a LUT that is 16GB large. To counteract this, [3] uses a “sampled LUT”, where only a subset of the possible input patches are sampled for use in the LUT; specifically, they found that sampling the color space of \(0\) to \(2^8-1\) uniformly (including endpoints) with a sampling interval of \(2^4\) over each pixel of the input patch worked well to reduce the size of the LUT while retaining good performance, reducing the 16GB LUT to just \((1+\frac{2^8}{2^4})^4 2^2 = 334084\) bytes, or about 326KB.</p>

<p style="max-width: 70%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/lutsizes.png" alt="LUT sizes" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 11. A comparison of LUT sizes for \(r=4\) [3].</em></p>

<p>Of course, this sampled LUT introduces the issue of indexing: how do we index from the LUT if the input patch doesn’t match a patch that was seen while filling out the table? For this, the authors used interpolation; instead of indexing one upscaled patch, we can interpolate between up to \(2^n\) patches, for a RF size \(n\). For instance, for a LUT where \(n=2\), using a sampling interval of \(2^4\), getting the upscaled patch for an input patch where \(I_0 = 8, I_1 = 8\) would require interpolating between \(LUT[0][0], LUT[0][1], LUT[1][0], LUT[1][1]\). Using this sampling interval, these nearest points can actually be found easily by looking at the bit representation of \(I_j\): the first 4 bits, when converted to integer, will be the index of the lower part of the interpolation (e.g. for \(I_j = 20\), 20 \(\to\) 00010100, and then 0001 \(\to\) 1, meaning that \(LUT[1]\) will be the lower part of the interpolation and \(LUT[2]\) will be the upper part); this method of indexing for the interpolation points adds even further to the LUT’s speed. The issue of interpolating between points in \(n\) dimensional space is complex in its own right, though we note that the authors found that linear interpolation was slower than triangular interpolation (and its higher-dimensional couterparts), especially for larger \(n\).</p>

<p><em>Fig 12. A comparison of interpolation methods for \(n=2, 3, 4\) [3].</em></p>

<h4 id="rotational-ensemble">Rotational Ensemble</h4>

<p>Additionally, during training and testing, the authors employed the strategy of “rotational ensemble”. This is a method of data augmentation that involves:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>rotating each input by 90, 180, and 270 (and 0) degrees</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>feeding each of the 4 rotations of the input into the model</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>rotating each the super-resolution outputs such that they are all at their original orientation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>taking the average over the 4 outputs, and treating that as your final output</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This method is well-suited to our task; images that are rotated still fall under our base assumption of what “real” images look like for super resolution, so the model can improve by optimizing over them. In our case, this method can actually improve the effective receptive field of the model substantially:</p>

<p style="max-width: 80%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/rotensemble.png" alt="Rotational Ensemble Illustration" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 13. An illustration of the effect of rotational ensemble on the receptive field; a 2x2 RF is effectively increased to a 3x3 RF [3].</em></p>

<p>During training, rotational ensemble simply works well as a way to increase your dataset size. However, this method can be used in inference as well; we can construct 4 different super-resolution predictions using the LUT, and then average them together. For a 2x2 square RF, one can see, in the illustration above representing 2x upscaling, that the relative position of the patch in the output corresponding to the RF in the input will be determined by the relative position of the top-left pixel of the RF in the input image; that is, any RF in the input, no matter the rotation of the image, will correspond to the same patch in the output as long as the top-left pixel of the RF is the same across those RFs in the input. So, when we look at the RFs across our rotational ensemble when the top-left pixel is kept constant, we see that their union will be a 3x3 area in the input, which means that the given output patch will be influenced by all pixels in the 3x3 area, effectively increasing our inference RF size to 9.</p>

<p>While this does increase our inference computation time by a factor of 4 (discounting rotations and averaging), it is likely a worthy trade-off for such a substantial increase in RF size, which would normally require increasing the LUT size to an unmanageable degree.</p>

<h4 id="results-1">Results</h4>

<p style="max-width: 80%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/lut_comparison.png" alt="LUT Comparison Table" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 14. Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and runtime of various methods for 320 x 180 -&gt; 1280 x 720 upscaling [3].</em></p>

<p>There are 3 models mentioned in the paper: V, F, and S, which have a receptive field of 2, 3, and 4, respectively. F and S use a sampled LUT with a sampling interval of \(2^4\), while V uses a full LUT. We see that the LUT methods provide a good tradeoff in terms of speed vs reconstruction quality, where F is even faster than bicubic interpolation, and V is even faster than bilinear interpolation.</p>

<p style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/lutqualitative.png" alt="LUT qualitative results" /></p>

<p><em>Fig 16. Quantitative comparison of results; runtimes for all methods besides sparse coding are on a Galaxy S7 phone [3].</em></p>

<p>We see that, quantitatively, all LUT variants perform substantially better than traditional interpolation upscaling methods, and are competitive with methods that require far greater runtime and/or storage space. Interestingly, there are some cases where the F model seems to perform quantitatively better than the S model, despite the fact that the only difference between them is that S has a larger receptive field. This likely just indicates a plateau in performance wrt receptive field size, or the differently shaped receptive fields may fare differently on different datasets (since RF=3 for F and RF=4 for S, the RF for F is a line and the RF for S is a square).</p>

<p>LUT methods are an interesting way to make super-resolution more efficient; instead of making a more efficient network, it avoids using a network for inference altogether. However, there are some obvious flaws: the quantitative results do not make it state-of-the-art in that regard, and the methodology of using the same LUT for each color channel independently seems somewhat unintuitive. Additionally, a given LUT is confined to a fixed receptive field size and upscaling factor; an entirely new SR network and table must be created to change these factors, which restricts the method’s practical use.</p>

<h4 id="im-lut">IM-LUT</h4>

<p>Since its invention in 2021, there have been numerous published papers for extensions and modifications to the LUT. One of these, published in 2025, is Interpolation Mixing LUT, or IM-LUT [5]. IM-LUT allows for the model to adapt to the scaling factor at inference time, meaning that a single IM-LUT can be used to scale any image to any size. This is achieved by first upscaling the input image with standard interpolation algorithms, such as bicubic upsampling, and then using a standard LUT on the upscaled image. However, the IM-LUT can also adapt its interpolation to the input image dynamically; a single IM-LUT first uses many different interpolation algorithms, and then uses a weighted average, with weights based on the image itself and the given scale factor, to combine the interpolations together before the final refinement LUT. With this, the IM-LUT can adapt to any scaling factor while still also dynamically adapting to the specific input image.</p>

<p>Now, we go through the structure of the IM-LUT.</p>

<h4 id="im-net">IM-Net</h4>

<p style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/imnet.png" alt="IM Net" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 17. IM-Net, the network used to generate the LUTs for IM-LUT [5].</em></p>

<p>There are two overall parts to the IM-Net: weight map prediction, and image refinement. Image refinement is simply a network that refines an the interpolated input image; it takes an image of any given size, and produces an image of the same size. This part of the network is simple, but the weight maps are more involved:</p>

<p>The IM-LUT works with a fixed set of \(K\) interpolation functions, and for any given image, the network predicts per-pixel weights for each interpolation function; these weight maps allow the network to take advantage of the fact that different interpolation methods may fare better in different areas of a given image. The weight maps are a combination of the output of two other networks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An image-to-weight map network, that takes the low-resolution image and produces low-resolution weight maps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An upscaling factor-to-scale vector network (“scale modulator”), that takes the scaling factor as input and outputs a vector of per-interpolation function weights.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The weights from the scale modulator are multiplied by the initial weight maps (one scale weight per weight map) to produce the final weight maps. The networks optimize their predictions of these weight maps as so:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For a given image (where the ground truth is known) and upscaling factor, downscale the image and then get interpolations back to the original size using each given interpolation function.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calculate per-interpolation deviations from the GT image using per-pixel L1 loss, i.e. 
\(E_k[i, j] = |\hat I_k[i, j] - I_{\text{GT}}[i, j]|\) 
for \(k=1,...,K\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compute ground-truth weight maps as a temperature-controlled per-pixel softmax over all negative interpolation deviations, i.e.
\(W^{GT}_k[i, j] = \frac{e^{-\beta E_k[i, j]}}{\sum_{\ell=1}^K e^{-\beta E_\ell[i, j]}}\) 
for \(\beta\) being the temperature constant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compute the “guide” loss (or, the weight map loss) as the L2 reconstruction loss between the predicted and ground-truth weight maps, that is
\(\mathcal{L}_{\text{guide}} = \sum_{\ell=1}^K ||\hat W_\ell - W^{GT}_\ell||_2\)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Then, when the predicted weight maps are used to create a final interpolated image, and that is run through the refinement network, the final reconstruction loss can be found as 
\(\mathcal{L}_{\text{rec}} = ||\hat I - I^{GT}||_2\) 
and the final loss that we optimize over is 
\(\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{rec}} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{guide}}\) 
where \(\lambda\) is our trade-off hyperparameter. With this, we can optimize both the refinement and the weight map predictions at once, and we can vary the upscaling factor to ensure that the network can adapt well to different amounts of upscaling.</p>

<h4 id="im-lut-1">IM-LUT</h4>

<p style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/imlut.png" alt="IM LUT" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 18. An overview of the way in which the LUTs are created and used [5].</em></p>

<p>Now, we have to transfer the IM-Net to LUTs. Given that IM-Net has 3 distinct sub-networks (scaling factor network, weight map network, and refinement network), we will have 3 LUTs; note that the refinement and weight map networks each use convolutional networks that leave each pixel of the output with a 2x2 receptive field in the input, as was seen with the original LUT. Additionally, each LUT is created with a sampling-interval scheme and interpolated indexing, as was also seen with the standard LUT (except for the scale LUT, which uses nearest neighbor interpolation). Specifically, the scale modulator LUT is indexed by a single number and outputs a vector of \(K\) weights, making it small and efficient; the weight map LUT is indexed by 4 pixel values and outputs \(K\) pixel values (since the weight map network <em>does not</em> perform any resizing), making it similar in size to the standard LUT; the refiner LUT is indexed by 4 pixels and outputs 1 pixel value (again, no resizing), making it smaller than the standard LUT. We see that, unlike the standard LUT, the size of the LUTs has no dependence on the scale factor; however, given that the refiner LUT will be used on the entire upscaled image, the overall computational complexity will increase with the scale factor (though, as noted in [5], it does not increase substantially).</p>

<p>Once the LUTs are computed, they can be used as stand-ins for the networks (as in the standard LUT), and then images can be upscaled as they were in IM-Net.</p>

<h4 id="results-2">Results</h4>

<p style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/imlutqualitative.png" alt="IM LUT qualitative" /></p>

<p><em>Fig 20. Multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, required storage, and PSNR for various super-resolution methods [5].</em></p>

<p>Given the freedom to choose interpolation functions, the authors highlight a few possible combinations of functions: in the table above, N means “nearest neighbor”, L means “bilinear”, C means “bicubic” and Z means “lanczos”, another kind of interpolation algorithm that uses windowed normalized sine functions; the letters, when put together, indicate that the given IM-LUT uses all of those interpolation functions. We see that the IM-LUT methods manage to be very efficient on storage and, for certain combinations of interpolations, on computations, as well; at the same time, they have much better performance than any single interpolation function, and, while not being state-of-the-art quantitatively, stay competitive with other LUT or similarly-efficient SR methods that require more storage and, in the case of the other LUT methods, cannot use a single model to adapt to different scaling factors.</p>

<p style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/weightmaps.png" alt="IM LUT weight maps" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 21. Analysis of weight maps for different interpolation functions [5].</em></p>

<p>From the color-coded weight maps above, we see that the model is, in fact, using the weight maps to adapt to the input image. For instance, when nearest-neighbor and bilinear interpolation are used together, we see that the bilinear interpolation is prioritized in areas of low brightness, while the nearest neighbor method is used elsewhere. However, we also see that when nearest-neighbor, bilinear, and bicubic interpolation are used together, the nearest-neighbor interpolation has very little influence, indicating that one could even use the weight maps as a form of interpolation function selection, similar to how L1 regularization is used as variable selection in linear regression.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h4>

<p>The IM-Net is already an interesting kind of reparameterization of the problem of learning-based super-resolution; instead of directly learning how to upscale an image, the network instead learns how to ensemble a set of given interpolation functions to do upscaling. This modular design allows for a great deal of flexibility in the model, as it can be combined with any arbitrary-scale upscaling method, even other learning-based methods, without any change to the core architecture. Of course, in this case, our real goal is a LUT-based method; in the realm of LUT-based methods, IM-LUT still stands out for its capability of arbitrary-scale super-resolution. Dynamically adapting to different scales will be a practical necessity for any super-resolution method, so it will be interesting to see if, as time goes on, efficient super-resolution methods will expand further in the direction of the IM-LUT, or if an entirely different architecture will rise to the top; the obvious downside of LUT methods is their low accuracy, so it will be especially noteworthy if a whole new kind of model structure can improve on this while retaining the benefits of LUT and allowing for arbitrary scales.</p>

<h3 id="unfolding-networks">Unfolding Networks</h3>

<p>The “unfolding” in “unfolding network” refers to splitting up the problem of image reconstruction into two distinct subproblems, that being (1) deblurring and upsampling, and (2) denoising. With this approach, one can show that problem (1) has a closed-form optimal solution that can explicitly adapt to specific given types of degradation with 0 learned parameters; this greatly reduces the burden on the learned portion of the network, which now only needs to do denoising. The method is a kind of fusing of model-based and learning-based approaches; despite involving a variant of a UNet, it is designed to be zero-shot adaptable to any kind of degradation that is parameterized by a known blurring kernel, downsampling factor, and noise level.</p>

<p>Now, we can go through and derive the method ourselves to illustrate how it arises:</p>

<h4 id="derivation">Derivation</h4>

<p>The basic assumption will be that the input image for the method will be the blurred, downsampled, and additive white Gaussian noise-ed version of a ground-truth image, or in other words, our degraded image \(\vec y\) is</p>

\[\vec y = (\vec x \otimes \vec k)\downarrow_s + \vec N\]

<p>where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(\vec x \otimes \vec k\) represents the application of blurring kernel \(\vec k\) to ground-truth image \(\vec x\) (via convolution)</li>
  <li>\(\downarrow_s\) represents downsampling (decimation) by a factor of \(s\)</li>
  <li>\(\vec N \sim N(\vec 0, \sigma^2 I)\) for noise level \(\sigma \in \mathbb{R}^+\)</li>
</ul>

<p>Given that \(\vec y \sim N((\vec x \otimes \vec k)\downarrow_s, \sigma^2 I)\), its PDF is</p>

\[P(\vec y | \vec x) = \frac 1 {(2\pi\sigma^2)^{\frac p 2}}e^{-\frac 1 {2\sigma^2}||(\vec x \otimes \vec k)\downarrow_s - \vec y||_2^2}\]

<p>Furthermore, it will be useful to have an image prior, which we will define as</p>

\[\Phi(\vec x) = -\log P(\vec x)\]

<p>which will stand as a measure of how “natural” an image \(\vec x\) is, ideally being minimised for any of our ground truth images and being maximised for images that are very noisy or unrealistic (i.e. unlike our GT images); we could interpret it simply as the negative logarithm of the a-priori probability distribution function of our ground truth images. In a practical sense, incorporating such a measure in our optimization will push our model toward creating images that conform to the patterns that typically appear in real images regarding color, brightness, etc, as opposed to overfitting on an image reconstruction loss function (in other words, a form of regularization).</p>

<p>Now, under a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) framework, our goal in super-resolution, given a degraded image \(\vec y\) conforming to the assumptions above, can be defined as finding</p>

\[\hat x = \arg \max_{\vec x} P(\vec x | \vec y) \\\]

<p>Or, in other words, the clean image that the degraded image most likely started as. From Bayes theorem, we have</p>

\[P(\vec x | \vec y) = \frac{P(\vec y | \vec x)P(\vec x)}{P(\vec y)} \propto P(\vec y | \vec x)P(\vec x)\]

<p>Since \(P(\vec y)\) is constant with regard to \(\vec x\). So now,</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\hat x &amp;= \arg \max_{\vec x} P(\vec x | \vec y) \\
&amp;= \arg \max_{\vec x} P(\vec y | \vec x)P(\vec x) \\
&amp;= \arg \min_{\vec x} -\log(P(\vec y | \vec x)P(\vec x)) = \arg \min_{\vec x} -\log P(\vec y | \vec x) - \log P(\vec x) \\
&amp;= \arg \min_{\vec x} -(\log(\frac 1 {(2\pi\sigma^2)^{\frac d 2}}) - \frac 1 {2\sigma^2}||(\vec x \otimes \vec k)\downarrow_s - \vec y||_2^2) + \Phi(\vec x) \\
&amp;= \arg \min_{\vec x} \frac 1 {2\sigma^2}||(\vec x \otimes \vec k)\downarrow_s - \vec y||_2^2 + \Phi(\vec x)
\end{aligned}\]

<p>Additionally, for practical reasons, we often include a “trade-off” hyperparameter, which we represent with \(\lambda\), to balance the influence between our prior term \(\Phi\) and our data term 
\(||(\vec x \otimes \vec k)\downarrow_s - \vec y||_2^2\)
, so we have</p>

\[\hat x = \arg \min_{\vec x} \frac 1 {2\sigma^2}||(\vec x \otimes \vec k)\downarrow_s - \vec y||_2^2 + \lambda\Phi(\vec x)\]

<p>Instead of directly minimizing this expression with something like gradient descent, one can actually notice that 
\(\arg \min_{\vec x} ||(\vec x \otimes \vec k)\downarrow_s - \vec y||_2^2\)
 has a closed form solution (which we will detail later); so, to take advantage of this fact, we can decouple the data term and prior term in our optimization by using half-quadratic splitting, where we introduce an auxiliary variable \(\vec z\) into our optimization:</p>

\[\min_{\vec x, \vec z}\frac 1 {2\sigma^2}||(\vec z \otimes \vec k)\downarrow_s - \vec y||_2^2 + \lambda\Phi(\vec x) + \frac \mu 2 ||\vec x - \vec z||_2^2\]

<p>Now, \(\mu\) is a hyperparameter controlling how much leeway we want to give \(\vec x\) and \(\vec z\) to be different, where \(\mu \to +\infty\) recovers our original problem. Now, given that we have two optimization variables instead of just one, we can <em>unfold</em> the target and perform alternating iterative optimization (with \(j\) as the step number):</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\vec z_j &amp;= \arg \min_{\vec z} \frac 1 {2\sigma^2}||(\vec z \otimes \vec k)\downarrow_s - \vec y||_2^2 + \frac \mu 2 ||\vec x_{j-1} - \vec z||_2^2 \\
\vec x_j &amp;= \arg \min_{\vec x} \lambda\Phi(\vec x) + \frac \mu 2 ||\vec x - \vec z_j||_2^2
\end{aligned}\]

<p>Now, it may be useful to change the value of \(\mu\) throughout our optimization; a small \(\mu\) near the start of our optimization will help speed up convergence, and a large \(\mu\) near the end will ensure that our solution actually corresponds to the original problem. So, define \(\mu_1, ..., \mu_J\) for an optimization of \(J\) steps, and let \(\alpha_j = \mu_j\sigma^2\), so we have</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\vec z_j &amp;= \arg \min_{\vec z} ||(\vec z \otimes \vec k)\downarrow_s - \vec y||_2^2 + \alpha_j ||\vec x_{j-1} - \vec z||_2^2 \\
\vec x_j &amp;= \arg \min_{\vec x} \Phi(\vec x) + \frac {\mu_j} {2\lambda} ||\vec x - \vec z_j||_2^2
\end{aligned}\]

<p>Now, as alluded, \(\vec z_j\) actually still has a closed form solution:</p>

\[\vec z_j  = \mathcal{F}^{-1} \left(\frac{1}{\alpha_j}\left(\vec d - \overline{\mathcal{F}(\vec k)} \odot_s \frac{(\mathcal{F}(\vec k)\vec d) \Downarrow_s}{(\overline{\mathcal{F}(\vec k)}\mathcal{F}(\vec k))\Downarrow_s + \alpha_j} \right) \right)\]

<p>where</p>

\[\vec d = \overline{\mathcal{F}(\vec k)}\mathcal{F}(\vec y \uparrow_s) + \alpha_j \mathcal{F}(\vec x_{j-1})\]

<p>and \(\mathcal{F}\) denotes the discrete FFT (and \(\mathcal{F}^{-1}\) is the inverse discrete FFT), \(\odot_s\) is the distinct block processing operator with element-wise multiplication, \(\Downarrow_s\) denotes the block downsampler, and \(\uparrow_s\) denotes the upsampler. The derivation of this solution is too long to include here, but is detailed in [4].</p>

<p>So, it remains to find 
\(\vec x_j = \arg \min_{\vec x} \Phi(\vec x) + \frac {\mu_j} {2\lambda} ||\vec x - \vec z_j||_2^2\). 
One can notice that this is similar to our very first optimization target; indeed, finding \(\vec x_j\) is equivalent to removing additive white Gaussian noise from \(\vec z_j\) with \(\sigma^2_\text{noise} = \frac {\lambda} {\mu_j}\) under a MAP framework. So, for convenience, we define 
\(\beta_j = \sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{\mu_j}}\)
 (the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise), and we have that finding \(x_j\) is equivalent to a Gaussian denoising problem with noise level \(\beta_j\) (or, \(\sigma^2_\text{noise} = \beta_j^2\)).</p>

<p>Given that this is a simple denoising task, we can opt for a denoising neural network.</p>

<h4 id="denoising-network">Denoising Network</h4>

<p>The paper in question uses a “ResUNet”, which is a variant of a UNet:</p>

<p style="max-width: 80%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/UNet.png" alt="Unfolding UNet" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 22. UNet architecture as depicted in  [6].</em></p>

<p>The ResUNet involves four scales, in which 2x2 strided convolutions and 2x2 transposed convolutions are adopted for down- and up-scaling, respectively, and residual blocks with the same structure as from ResNet are added between these size changes; of course, skip connections between downscaling and upscaling are also employed, as in the regular UNet.</p>

<p>In order to ensure adaptibility and nonblind-ness of the method, it is useful to incorporate the noise level \(\beta_j\) into the network input. The method in [2] for doing this is fairly simple: given an input image \(3 \times H \times W\), a constant matrix with size \(H \times W\) with all entries equal to \(\beta_j\) is appended on the channel dimension to create an input of shape \(4 \times H \times W\), which is fed into the network as normal.</p>

<h4 id="network-modules">Network Modules</h4>

<p>Now, to explicitly modularize the method so far, the authors introduce various network modules. First, we have the data module \(\mathcal{D}\), which is used to give us \(\vec z_j = \mathcal{D}(\vec x_{j-1}, s, \vec k, \vec y, \alpha_j)\), which is the optimal solution to</p>

\[\vec z_j = \arg \min_{\vec z} ||(\vec z \otimes \vec k)\downarrow_s - \vec y||_2^2 + \alpha_j ||\vec x_{j-1} - \vec z||_2^2\]

<p>Of course, this is achieved with the closed form solution detailed above, so this module has no learnable parameters and can explicitly adapt to any blurring kernel, scale factor and noise level \(\sigma\) (through \(\alpha_j\)).</p>

<p>The prior module \(\mathcal{P}\), which is used to give us \(\vec x_j = \mathcal{P}(\vec z_j, \beta_j)\), is trained to optimize the other objective</p>

\[\vec x_j = \arg \min_{\vec x} \lambda\Phi(\vec x) + \frac \mu 2 ||\vec x - \vec z_j||_2^2\]

<p>As alluded, this encapsulates the denoising ResUNet.</p>

<p>Lastly, the hyperparameter module \(\mathcal{H}\) is introduced to allow for dynamic hyperparameter selection.
This module takes in the noise level \(\sigma\) and scale factor \(s\) and uses a MLP to predict optimal \(\lambda\) and \(\mu_1, ..., \mu_J\) for the given problem, which can then be used to compute \(\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_J\) and \(\beta_1, ..., \beta_J\).</p>

<p><em>Fig 23. The full architecture of the unfolding network [2].</em></p>

<p>These modules are combined by first predicting hyperparameters \(\alpha_j\) and \(\beta_j\) through the hyperparameter module, and then stacking the data and prior modules sequentially, performing iterative optimization on the low resolution input image (which is first upsampled with nearest-neighbor interpolation to be the target size before being fed into the network).</p>

<p>With all of this, the authors note that the model is trained in a end-to-end fashion, where scaling factors, blurring kernels, and noise levels are sampled from a pool throughout training to generate LR samples. While certain portions of the network can explicitly adapt to these factors, the denoising network (and hyperparameter module) cannot do so in the same manner, and so varying these values throughout training ensures that the network, as a whole, is robust and adaptable.</p>

<p><em>Fig 24. Quantitative and qualitative results of various methods [2].</em></p>

<p>We see that the unfolding network performs favorably compared to its peers, both qualitatively and quantitatively, for a variety of scaling factors, noise levels, and blurring kernels. Due to the explicit adaptibility to these factors, the model can even be effective even at parsing images that humans may have trouble with:</p>

<h4 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion</h4>

<p>Of course, in practice, we often may not have much idea about the specific blurring kernel or noise level for our given image, which limits the effective use of this model structure. Additionally, performing denoising only with convolutions, despite the use of a UNet, may limit the method’s effective receptive field.</p>

<p>However, in all, the deep unfolding network is an interesting blend of model-based and learning-based methods; they can both be very useful in their own right, and can empower each other when combined. The efficient, learning-free data module makes the optimization problem of the learned prior module much easier, and attains an optimal solution that could have required many times more parameters to replicate in a learning-based method. Conversely, the prior module can give us an accurate approximation for a complex, statistical problem, which model-based methods can struggle with.</p>

<h3 id="adaptive-sparse-transformer-ast">Adaptive Sparse Transformer (AST)</h3>

<p>While Transformers have shown immense success in vision tasks due to their ability to model complex, long-range relationships, this can also be a detriment; for reconstructing a given portion of an image, there are likely many parts of the image that are not relevant, and trying to use information from those parts will only add noise to the reconstruction. The self-attention mechanism of the regular Transformer has all tokens attend to all other tokens, with (Softmax) attention weights that will always be greater than 0. While the Transformer can use very small attention scores as a way of giving less attention to irrelevant tokens, it is likely useful to give the model more direct flexibility in selecting relevant image regions that does not require assigning scores of large magnitude; for this, [7] proposes the Adaptive Sparse Transformer (AST).</p>

<p>The AST changes the standard Transformer architecture in two ways: first, instead of just using Softmax on the attention scores to get attention weights, it introduces sparse score selection by using a weighted sum of the Softmax and squared-ReLU of the attention scores to get the attention weights, where the weight between the two schemes is a learnable parameter. With this, our Transformer has both “dense” (Softmax) attention weights, which makes all weights greater than 0, and “sparse” (squared ReLU) weights, where many weights will be exactly 0 and larger weights will be further amplified, and the model can learn how best to balance these two methods for the task at hand. This self-attention mechanism is known as Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA), and it is notable as a potentially powerful modification to the self-attention mechanism that requires just 1 extra parameter (as the weights can be computed as \(\text{sigmoid}(b), 1-\text{sigmoid}(b)\) for learnable \(b\)).</p>

<p style="max-width: 70%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/assa.png" alt="AST Architecture" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 26. Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) [7]</em></p>

<p>Secondly, the AST replaces the standard MLP of the Transformer with what is known as a Feature Refinement Feed-forward Network (FRFN).</p>

<p style="max-width: 70%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/frfn.png" alt="AST Architecture" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 27. Feature Refinement Feed-forward Network (FRFN) [7]</em></p>

<p>Aside from being a post-attention network with convolutions that takes advantage of the spatial relationship of the tokens, the FRFN aims to address redundancy in the channel dimension after using ASSA. It utilizes partial convolutions, which only convolves on a portion of the channels, and depthwise convolutions, which convolves each channel independently, along with splitting the image along its channels and then combining the two halves to efficiently provide a post-ASSA transformation that can further attenuate the information from features extracted by the self-attention while giving the model some flexilibity to clear uninformative channels.</p>

<h3 id="putting-it-together">Putting it Together</h3>

<p>Recall the structure of the Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT):</p>

<p style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/01/HAT_architecture.png" alt="HAT architecture" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 28. HAT Architecture Overview [1].</em></p>

<p>One can see that the OCAB at the end of each RHAG acts as a sort of “gate” between RHAG blocks. Additionally, given the large key and value windows for the OCA, part of the purpose of the OCAB is to give each segment of the image a chance to incorporate together information from a larger portion of the image. However, it is likely that portions of these larger windows are not useful for the image reconstruction task, so this larger window allows for ample noise to seep through into our image tokens. So, we propose a modification to the HAT architecture that replaces the attention mechanism of the OCA with the Adaptive Sparse Attention scheme of the AST, and, subsequently, replaces the MLP of the OCAB with the FRFN. We hypothesize that this can temper the OCA and prevent noise issues from the larger windows, but can also act as a overall information gate for each window itself at the end of the RHAG, as the windows will perform cross-attention where the set of key and value pixel tokens are a superset of the query pixel tokens. Given that the principal design goal of the HAT is to use as much of the image as possible during reconstruction, the sparse attention may work well to balance that image-overuse, resulting in a model that has access to a large portion of the image but which can easily select which portions of the image are most useful.</p>

<p>Since we are giving the model this selective capability, we can likely afford to increase the size of the OCA window; in [1], they had found that an overlap ratio of 0.5 was optimal (meaning that key and value windows were 1.5x as large as the query window in each dimension), but a value of 0.75 produced slightly worse results. So, we propose that increasing the overlap ratio to 0.75 will better utilize the sparse attention, giving the model access to more information that it can select from, while remaining computationally efficient during the windowed cross-attention.</p>

<p>Specifically, in our experiment, we will be modifying the architecture of the HAT-S, the smallest HAT model, for practical reasons, and training it for doing 4x image upscaling.</p>

<h3 id="results-4">Results</h3>

<p>Here is a comparison of average PSNR on benchmark datasets between the base HAT-S and our model:</p>

</table>

<p>Unfortunately, our modification to the HAT-S was unable to match the results of the regular HAT-S. A possible reason is that the sparse attention is not particularly useful for 4x upscaling; there are few pixels in the starting image compared to the output image, so each one is more likely to hold important information than if we were doing something like 2x upscaling. Additionally, the size of the overlap window may be an issue: we did not get the chance to experiment with other sizes, so it is possible that the smaller 0.5 ratio may have actually worked better for our model, still benefitting from the sparse attention mechanism.</p>

<p>We see similar qualitative peformance between HAT-S and our modification, though a closer inspection does confirm that our model produces slightly blurrier results.</p>

<p>In any case, the sparse attention mechanism and FRFN are interesting modifications to the Transformer; while our own experiment with the modification did not produce favorable results, we hope that future research continues to try to improve the current architectures and create entirely new ones.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-3">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Image super-resolution (or, simply, image upscaling and reconstruction) is a foundational vision problem that has, in a sense, been around for as long as images have been on computers. In recent years, methods that use deep learning for computer vision have shown success for this problem, having the capacity to model very complex relationships between regions of an image to perform upscaling and de-degradation. However, this class of methods is not a monolith; there are many ways to utilize deep learning for this task, all with their own quirks, advantages, and disadvantages. The Hybrid Attention Transformer is an example of a Transformer-based method, and as such, it enjoys the capacity to scale very large to model complex reconstruction algorithms, but may suffer from issues of computational efficicency due to this scale; it stands out among other Transformer-based methods for its ability to create a very large receptive field for reconstruction, fully utilizing a given image for the task instead of just a segment of it. Look-Up Table methods sit on the other end of the computational complexity spectrum, doing away with an inference-time network and instead utilizing a quantized representation of deep network via a LUT. Of course, while this is very practically efficient, the method somewhat lacks in reconstruction accuracy and requires a fixed scale; developing extensions to the LUT to ameliorate these issues while mainitaining its speed is an active area of research. Finally, Unfolding Networks take an interesting, more fine-grained approach to the process of upscaling and de-degredation, by separating the problem into two distinct parts and leveraging learning-free, model-based methods in combination with learning-based methods to create an algorithm that is lightweight and robust. Based on the variety among existing super resolution architectures, it will be exciting to see what else is developed in the future.</p>

<p>In our experiment, we attempted to combine two existing super-resolution architectures, the Hybrid Attention Transformer and Adaptive Sparse Transformer, to determine if their opposing design philosophies could temper each other and result in a net-benefit. Unfortunately, this did not seem to be the case, as our modification to the HAT only worsened its performance. However, both of these architectures have been successful in their own right, and there likely exist yet-undiscovered modifications that will make them even more effective.</p>

<h3 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h3>

<p>Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is the task of identifying a person’s emotional state from an image or video of their face. Typical FER systems classify facial expressions into a fixed set of categories. With recent advances in deep learning and computer vision, FER has become an important research problem due to both its technical challenges and practical relevance.</p>

<p>Understanding emotion plays a key role in human communication, and enabling machines to recognize emotional cues is essential for advancing human-computer interaction. Facial expressions provide a direct and informative signal of emotion, making FER a valuable component in building human-aware artificial intelligence systems. As these systems improve, they will be able to respond more effectively to users by adapting their behavior based on emotional feedback. Some practical use cases are mental health monitoring, education technology, customer experience, and driver attention systems.</p>

<p>Despite this progress, FER remains a challenging task. Facial expressions can be subtle, ambiguous, and subjective, and are influenced by factors such as lighting, head pose, occlusion, and individual differences in facial structure. Emotions are also not always clearly separable and may overlap between categories, further complicating classification. This paper aims to explore recent advances and state-of-the-art models that address these challenges in facial emotion recognition.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="2-dataset">2. Dataset</h3>

<h4 id="21-fer-2013">2.1. FER-2013</h4>

<p>FER-2013 was the first large scale dataset for facial expression recognition. It was released on Kaggle in 2013 by Pierre Luc Carrier and Aaron Courville, and contains 35,887 48x48 grayscale images, with 32,298 released publicly for training/validation, and 3,589 hidden for testing. It divides images into seven categories: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral, though a human would recognize some images containing more subtle emotions (pride, embarrassment, contempt). This dataset is particularly challenging because it contains variations in lighting, background, and facial position.</p>

<p>The dataset was generated by using the Google Image Search API to search for facial images. Queries were constructed by combining emotion related keywords like “blissful”, “enraged”, and words related to gender, age, and ethnicity. In total, there were almost 600 query strings, and the first 1000 images returned from each query were kept. Then, the images were cropped using OpenCV facial recognition, and crowdsourced human labelers rejected incorrectly labeled images, modified crops if necessary, and filtered out duplicate images. Finally, the images were resized to 48x48 pixels and converted to grayscale.</p>

<p>However, the quality of labels and crops were underwhelming, likely due to crowd-sourced workers being paid little and prioritizing getting work done over ensuring tagging quality. One of the creators behind FER-2013 found human accuracy on a subset of the dataset to be only 65 ± 5%.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is a significant imbalance between classes, particularly toward emotions that are easier to recognize. The distribution of labels is shown below.</p>

<p style="width: 800px; max-width: 100%;"><br />
<img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/03/fer.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="22-fer-2016">2.2. FER+ (2016)</h4>

<p>To address these shortcomings, a group of researchers from Microsoft Research conducted a re-tagging of the FER-2013 dataset. They commissioned 10 taggers to label each image, obtaining a probability distribution of the emotion exhibited by each facial image (this is useful for one of the models discussed later). Additionally, the researchers introduced contempt as a new class. Some examples of corrected labels from the original FER dataset are shown below. The top labels are from FER, and the bottom labels are from FER+.</p>

<p><em>Some corrected image labels from FER+</em> [1].
<br /></p>

<p>177 images not containing faces or occluded faces were also removed.</p>

<p>However, one notable problem in the FER-2013 dataset that is still left unresolved by FER+ is the imbalance between classes. The distribution of labels from FER+ is shown below.</p>

<p style="width: 800px; max-width: 100%;"><br />
<img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/03/fer_plus.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>As you can see, there is a dramatic shift in the label distribution. For example, there were 5,121 images labeled as “fear” in the original FER, but only 825 in FER+.</p>

<h3 id="3-resface">3. ResFace</h3>

<h4 id="31-overview">3.1. Overview</h4>

<p>Facial Expression Recognition (FER) in real-world images is difficult because facial signals are subtle, easily hidden, and often influenced by pose variations. Traditional approaches train models to predict a single emotion label, assuming that each facial image reflects only a single pure expression. However, psychological studies and modern FER research show that real expressions often combine multiple emotions with varying intensities. This makes the single-label models insufficient for capturing the ambiguity that happens in human expression.</p>

<p>ResFace is proposed to solve these issues by introducing Label Distribution Learning (LDL) to model emotion mixtures and combat the noise caused by subjective annotations. It uses three key ideas, as shown in the Figure below.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Local Feature Extraction via a ResNet backbone to learn and extract local, low-level features from the image.</li>
  <li>Channel-Spatial Feature Aggregation to suppress redundant features caused by occlusion and background noise while highlighting semantically relevant cues.</li>
  <li>Compact Feature Aggregation for label distribution learning (LDL) so that the network predicts a probability distribution of emotions rather than a single class.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Overview of ResFace architecture</em> [7].
<br /></p>

<h4 id="32-local-feature-extraction">3.2. Local Feature Extraction</h4>
<p>The local feature extraction module is the first stage of the pipeline and is the backbone of ResFace. It uses ResNet-18 or ResNet-15 to capture the low-level and mid-level local features for FER. It is important to note that the design relies on the observation that local features are a basic necessity to classify emotional cues, as shown in prior research on FER. The figure below shows the full module and its ResNet-18 (or ResNet-50) backbone.</p>

<p style="width: 800px; max-width: 100%;"><br />
<img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/03/resface-feature-extraction.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><em>Architecture of Resnet-18</em> [7].
<br /></p>

<p>The input image of 224 x 224 x 3 is first passed through the standard Conv1 layer of Resnet, which is a 7 x 7 convolution followed by max-pooling. This produces an output feature map of size 56 x 56 x 64.</p>

<p>Then, the feature map is passed to subsequent residual blocks, where more complex local structures are captured through alternating 1 x 1 and 3 x 3 convolutional layers.This will contain spatially localized patterns like mouth curvature, eyebrow shape, and eye muscle tension, which carry the strongest emotional cues. Prior research on FER shows that these small-scale changes are important for distinguishing between expressions.</p>

<p>The colored blocks in the diagram visualize the progression through the ResNet stages. Unlike the standard ResNet architecture, ResFace also introduces a ConvTranspose2d upsampling layer at the end of the local extraction module. This operation is important because it prevents the network from collapsing local emotional detail too early, allowing the future modules to operate on feature maps with interpretable spatial structure.</p>

<h4 id="33-channel-spatial-feature-aggregation-module">3.3. Channel-Spatial Feature Aggregation Module</h4>

<p>The primary goal of this module is to address some of the challenges in FER such as occlusion and pose variations. It also addresses one of the drawbacks of the local feature extraction: not everything in the picture is useful, as some information is just background noise or redundant data. This module is designed to aggregate the representative features with the original local features and learn global-salience, which helps distinguish informative features from non-informative features.</p>

<p>Below is an image depicting where this module is located in the entire pipeline. The aggregation method is applied after Stage 2 of the ResNet backbone. As you can see from the “+” sign, it is aggregated via summation with the result from the local feature extraction module and passed into Stage 3 of the ResNet backbone to continue through the network.</p>

<p style="width: 800px; max-width: 100%;"><br />
<img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/03/resface-1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><em>The Channel-Spatial Feature Aggregation Module’s position in the ResFace pipeline</em> [7].
<br /></p>

<p>The module operates by calculating heatmaps that determine the importance of different features. The input to this module is high-level feature maps (denoted as Feastage2) which were generated by Stage 2 of the ResNet backbone.</p>

<p>The process is then split into 2 branches. The channel branch calculates the channel heatmaps (denoted as Zchannel). This consists of a Global Average Pooling layer followed by two Fully Connected layers. The spatial branch calculates the spatial heatmaps (denoted as Zspatial) which utilizes a series of convolutions, specifically a 1x1 followed by two 3x3s and finally a 1x1 layer to learn spatial features. The channel heatmap essentially tells us what type of information is important, while the spatial heatmap tells us where in the image the important information is located. Below is a diagram that shows these 2 branches:</p>

<p style="width: 800px; max-width: 100%;"><br />
<img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/03/resface-feature-aggregation.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><em>Channel-Spatial Feature Aggregation Module</em> [7].
<br /></p>

<p>Next, the heatmaps of the 2 branches are combined. It is important to note that both heatmaps are resized to match dimensions prior to adding them together. A sigmoid function is applied to this sum for normalization, generating the final combined heatmap (denoted as Z(Feastage2)). This is denoted by the “+” sign in the diagram above. The mathematical formula is as below:</p>

\[Z(Fea_{stage2})=\sigma(Z_{channel}(Fea_{stage2})+Z_{spatial}(Fea_{stage2}))\]

<p>Once the combined heatmap is generated, it is applied to the original image features through element-wise multiplication. This is denoted by the “x” sign in the diagram above. This effectively weighs the original features by their calculated importance with the formula below. It suppresses useless information and highlights important features, which allows the model to better handle challenges such as face rotation and occlusion.</p>

\[Fea_{modulated}=(Fea_{stage2})\otimes Z(Fea_{stage2})\]

<p>Finally, circling back to the original pipeline, the final feature set (denoted as Feafinal) is calculated via addition of the local and modulated features. Thus, the model retains original local information while benefiting from this global focus. This is what is passed into Stage 3 of the ResNet backbone. The formula is as below:</p>

\[Fea_{final}=Fea_{local} + Fea_{modulated}\]

<h4 id="34-compact-feature-aggregation-module--label-distribution-learning-ldl">3.4. Compact Feature Aggregation Module &amp; Label Distribution Learning (LDL)</h4>

<p>The Compact Feature Aggregation Module, as shown below, is the final processing stage in the ResFace pipeline before the system makes a classification decision. It is essential to note that this is not combined with the main architecture of the Local Feature Extraction Module + Channel-Spatial Feature Extraction Module, but rather done in parallel in order to compute the LDL loss at the end of the training process.</p>

<p style="width: 800px; max-width: 100%;"><br />
<img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/03/resface-2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><em>The Compact Feature Aggregation Module’s position in the ResFace pipeline</em> [7].
<br /></p>

<p>Beginning with the output of Conv1, the feature maps are passed through four consecutive convolutional blocks (Conv2 → Conv3 → Conv4 → Conv5). Each block reduces the spatial redundancy and preserves the semantically meaningful information related to facial expression intensity. As described in the name, the stacked convolutions filter the representation into a compact embedding that emphasizes the global structural cues rather than the fine-grained local texture. This differs from the local feature extraction module because the compact aggregation makes a more abstract feature space that is better aligned with the needs of distribution based supervision.</p>

<p>After the convolutional stack, the resulting feature map is flattened and passed to a fully connected layer. This output is then passed through a softmax function that produces a feature vector \(F_v = (F_{v_0}, F_{v_1}, F_{v_2}, ... , F_{v_{l−1}})\). This is the learned label distribution, which will then be used in label distribution learning.</p>

<p>Although traditional facial expression recognition models treat each image as belonging to exactly one emotion class, and as mentioned in the introduction, studies show that expressions often reflect mixtures of emotions with varying intensities. To address this, ResFace uses Label Distribution Learning (LDL), in which each image is supervised not by a single label but by a probability distribution over all emotion categories.</p>

<p>LDL is implemented using a Label Distribution Generator (LDG), which produces a soft target distribution \(Dis = (Dis_0,Dis_1,...,Dis_{l-1})\) where \(\sum^{l-1}_{j=0}\phi_j=1\).</p>

<p>The softmax output from the Compact Feature Aggregation Module is treated as the model’s predicted distribution \(Dis\). These two distributions are then compared during training, allowing ResFace to learn from mixed or ambiguous emotional cues rather than relying on a single hard label.</p>

<h4 id="35-train-validation-test-set-up">3.5. Train, Validation, Test Set-Up</h4>

<p>This model has been validated on 2 primary datasets: RAF-DB and FER+. RAF-DB contains 12,271 training set images, 3,068 testing set images, with labels annotated with 7 basic emotion classes. FER+ contains 28,709 training set images, 3,859 validation set images, and 3,589 testing set images.</p>

<p>Before the images enter the network, they are preprocessed by resizing to 224 x 224 dimensions with random cropping and random horizontal flipping augmentation. This ensures consistency and prevents the model from overfitting by memorizing the training data.</p>

<p>ResFace deviates from typical models in the way that instead of training the model to predict a single emotion (eg. 100% sad, 100% happy), label distribution learning is used. The motivation behind this is the fact that real-world emotions are often a mix of different emotions. Therefore, the LDG is used to create a soft distribution of probabilities of labels rather than a single hard label. The loss function used here is Cross-Entropy loss. It measures the difference between the distribution predicted by ResFace and the distribution generated by the LDG. The specific formula is as below. N is the number of samples, l is the number of emotion categories, and dis represents the predicted label distribution.</p>

\[Loss_{all}=-\frac{1}{N\times l}\sum^{N-1}{i=0}\sum^{l-1}_{m=0}dis^i_m\log(\overline{dis}^i_m)\]

<p>A typical technical configuration of this model is as follows. It uses a PyTorch framework running on NVIDIA Titan RTX. The ResFace architecture is initialized by training it from scratch. It uses Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as its optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.1 and batch size of 64.</p>

<h4 id="36-results">3.6. Results</h4>

<p>To evaluate the effectiveness of the ResFace model, experiments were conducted on two widely used facial expression recognition datasets: RAF-DB and FER+. The results demonstrate consistent improvements when integrating the three major components of ResFace:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Local Feature Extraction</li>
  <li>Channel–Spatial Feature Aggregation</li>
  <li>Compact Feature Aggregation + Label Distribution Learning (LDL)</li>
</ol>

<p>[7]
<br /></p>

<p>Table 2 displays the accuracy improvements in the RAF-DB dataset when using a ResNet-50 backbone. Starting from the baseline architecture (A), an accuracy of 88.02% is achieved. When the channel-spatial aggregation module is added (A + B), performance improves to 88.11%, indicating that attention over spatial locations and feature channels helps suppress redundant information. Adding the compact feature aggregation module with label distribution learning (A + C) further increases accuracy to 88.16%. The best performance is obtained when all components are combined (A + B + C), achieving an accuracy of 88.38%.</p>

<p style="width: 800px; max-width: 100%;"><br />
<img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/03/resface-table4.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>[7]
<br /></p>

<p>A similar trend is seen on the FER+ dataset using the same ResNet-50 backbone, as shown in table 4. The baseline ResNet-50 model (A) achieves an accuracy of 88.83%. Adding the channel–spatial aggregation module (A + B) improves accuracy to 89.46%, while adding the compact aggregation module with LDL (A + C) achieves 89.54%. When all components are integrated, the model reaches an accuracy of 89.87%, which is the highest among all tested configurations. Since FER+ contains many ambiguous and mixed expressions, the performance gain underscores the effectiveness of label distribution learning in capturing nuanced emotional information.</p>

<p style="width: 800px; max-width: 100%;"><br />

<p>[7]
<br /></p>

<p>Tables 5 and 6 compare ResFace with several state-of-the-art FER methods on RAF-DB and FER+, respectively. On RAF-DB, ResFace achieves accuracies of 88.21% with ResNet-18 and 88.38% with ResNet-50, outperforming many existing approaches, including RAN, LDL-ALSG, SCN, and IPA2LT. Despite having a relatively small number of parameters, ResFace achieves competitive performance compared to more complex models like gACNN, which requires higher computational cost. The results show that ResFace achieves a good balance between accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<p>On FER+, ResFace achieves an accuracy of 87.89% with ResNet-18 and 89.87% with ResNet-50, as shown in Table 6. The ResNet-50 version achieves the highest accuracy among the compared methods, surpassing traditional CNN-based approaches and matching or beating more recent attention-based models. Overall, the experimental results show that combining local feature learning, attention-based aggregation, and label distribution learning enables ResFace to model emotional ambiguity effectively while maintaining computational efficiency.</p>

<h4 id="37-tradeoffs">3.7. Tradeoffs</h4>

<p>The most significant advantage of this model is its use of Label Distribution Learning instead of single-label classification. This addresses the real world emotional complexity and reduces noise. Similarly, the model utilizes a “parallel” architecture during the training phase, specifically a Label Distribution Generator (LDG), to compute the loss, rather than relying solely on static hard labels. During the training stage, the LDG is fixed, acting as a stable teacher that guides the main architecture to learn informative features without the instability of optimizing the generator simultaneously. Finally, the core of the model, the Channel-Spatial Feature Aggregation Module improves feature quality by combining local feature importance with global salience. This solves the real-world problem of occlusion and pose variance.</p>

<p>With this, comes the difficulty of increased computational complexity and parameter count. The complexity of calculation increases as well, as the number of floating point operations is also higher. On the other hand, this increase could be justified by higher accuracy.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="4-emonext">4. EmoNeXt</h3>

<h4 id="41-overview">4.1. Overview</h4>

<p>Classical Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) approaches typically follow a two-step process: first, manually defining and extracting facial features (geometric or appearance-based), and second, classifying those features using models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLP).</p>

<p>The fundamental problem with this conventional methodology is that these two steps are performed separately, which can result in poorer performance, in particular when the dataset contains numerous sources of variability. This issue is addressed by DNNs which learn discriminative feature representations and simultaneously determine classification parameters directly from raw data.</p>

<p>The EmoNeXt framework was specifically developed to build upon the latest convolutional models (specifically ConvNeXt) and solve the problem of achieving high accuracy in complex, variable FER datasets. It addresses critical recognition challenges by integrating modules that automatically handle spatial transformations (like scale and rotation) and enhance the network’s ability to discriminate between features, aiming to significantly improve upon the original ConvNeXt network and existing state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p>EmoNeXt’s architecture builds off of ConvNeXt, integrating several specialized components to enhance robustness, feature extraction, and generalization capabilities for FER.</p>

<p style="width: 800px; max-width: 100%;"><br />
<img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/03/emonext.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><em>EmoNeXt architecture</em> [2].
<br /></p>

<p>The first specialized component is the Spatial Transformer Network (STN). This is a differentiable geometric transformation module that enables the network to automatically learn and apply spatial transformations to input images. This component is particularly valuable for FER because it allows the model to handle performance-degrading variations such as changes in scale, rotation, and translation of the facial image.</p>

<p>Following the STN, the inputs are passed through the ConvNeXt’s patchify module. This module efficiently down-samples the input image and captures relevant initial features using a non-overlapping convolution with a 4 x 4 kernel size.</p>

<p>The downscaled inputs proceed through the main ConvNeXt stages. A key modification in EmoNeXt is that each stage is immediately followed by a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block. SE blocks enhance the model’s representational power by adaptively recalibrating channel-wise features. They operate by emphasizing informative channels and suppressing less relevant ones, which improves the extraction of discriminative facial features for accurate emotion classification.</p>

<p>To optimize the model’s performance and improve generalization, EmoNeXt utilizes a final loss function (\(L_{final}\)) that combines the standard Cross-Entropy Loss (\(L_{CE}\)) with a Self-Attention (SA) regularization term (\(L_{SA}\)). The SA regularization term minimizes the variance of the attention weights, bringing the weights to be closer to their mean value (\(\overline{W}\)). This process promotes balanced importance across generated features, thereby helping the model produce more compact feature vectors during training.</p>

<h4 id="42-spatial-transformer-network">4.2. Spatial Transformer Network</h4>

<p>To account for variance in scale, rotation, skew, and translation between facial images, the authors introduced a Spatial Transformer Network as the first layer of the Network. Spatial Transformer networks learn an affine transformation (a transformation that preserves lines) to sample a specific region of it, as if cropping the image into a parallelogram.</p>

<p style="width: 800px; max-width: 100%;"><br />
<img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/03/spatial-transformer.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><em>Spatial Transformer Network modules</em> [2].
<br /></p>

<p>The Spatial Transformation Network consists of three parts: a localization network, which computes the transformation, a sampling grid generator, which creates a set of points where the input map should be sampled to produce the transformed output, and a sampler, which takes the sampling grid and the input image to produce the output map.</p>

<p>The localization network is essentially a CNN whose final fully connected layer has an output size of 6, one for each value of the 2 x 3 affine transformation matrix. The full architecture is shown below. Since the transformation is generated by a neural network, this means that the transformation is (1) different for each input image and (2) learned during training. Note that the affine transformation is from the output space to the input space, which simplifies sampling.</p>

This grid is represented as a tensor of shape \((N, H_{out}, W_{out}, 2)\), where N represents the batch size, and the 2 corresponds to an (x, y) coordinate pair. These coordinates are normalized to the range \([-1, 1]\) where \((-1, -1)\) is the top-left corner, \((1, 1)\) is the bottom-right corner, and \((0, 0)\) is the center of the image. This normalization makes the transformation scale-invariant to the actual pixel dimensions of the input.</p>

<p>For every \((x,y)\) coordinate in the grid, the sampler uses bilinear interpolation to fill in a value for each pixel in the output. Note that bilinear interpolation is fully differentiable, allowing for the entire Spatial Transformation Network to be updated through backpropagation.</p>

<h4 id="43-convnext">4.3. ConvNeXt</h4>

<p>The architecture known as ConvNeXt was introduced in 2022 as a pure convolutional model. Its development was largely inspired by recent advancements in Vision Transformers, but ConvNeXt was specifically designed to compete effectively with these state-of-the-art models while maintaining the fundamental simplicity and efficiency of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).</p>

<p>ConvNeXt incorporates several enhancements adapted from modern architectures and builds upon the design of a standard ResNet. These modifications define the efficiency and performance of the core ConvNeXt block.</p>

<p style="width: 800px; max-width: 100%;"><br />
<img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/03/convnext-block.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><em>ConvNeXt block</em> [2].
<br /></p>

<p>One modification the ConvNeXt block utilizes is larger kernel-sized and depthwise convolutions. It employs an inverted bottleneck design, which is critical for enhancing performance while simultaneously lowering the overall floating-point operations (FLOPs) of the network. This design helps increase the network width in an efficient manner.</p>

<p>ConvNeXt also adapted normalization and activation techniques often seen in advanced Transformer models to achieve slightly better performance. Specifically, it replaced the traditional ReLU activation function with GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Units) and substituted Batch Normalization (BN) with Layer Normalization (LN) as the normalization technique.</p>

<p>Scalability was also a significant focus for this  model. The architecture is flexible and was developed in multiple versions (Tiny, Small, Base, Large, and XLarge). These versions are differentiated by varying the number of channels (C) and blocks (B) used within each stage.</p>

<p>Lastly, when utilized in downstream tasks, such as in the EmoNeXt framework, the ConvNeXt architecture can leverage the pretrained weights sourced from the large-scale ImageNet-22k dataset<strong>.</strong> To ensure compatibility with these weights, input images must typically be resized.</p>

<h4 id="44-squeeze-and-excitation-blocks">4.4. Squeeze and Excitation Blocks</h4>

<p style="width: 800px; max-width: 100%;"><br />
<img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/03/squeeze-and-excite.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><em>Squeeze and Excitation Block module</em> [2].
<br /></p>

<p>The Squeeze and Excitation allows the network to give different weights to each channel, almost as if applying channel-wise attention.</p>

<p>In the Squeeze phase, global average pooling is applied to each channel of the input feature map, which results in a (1, 1, C) tensor. In the excite phase, this tensor is transformed using two fully connected layers. The first linear layer reduces the tensor to (1, 1, C/r) and is followed by a ReLU, and the second linear layer takes the tensor back to (1, 1, C) and is followed by a Sigmoid. The authors chose r=16. This bottleneck structure makes the computation more efficient and promotes learning important features over noise. The resulting attention weights are then multiplied element-wise with the original feature map, emphasizing important channels and suppressing less relevant ones.</p>

<h4 id="45-training">4.5. Training</h4>

<p>For training, a pretrained ConvNeXt on the ImageNet-22k dataset was modified to fit the architecture described above, and was fine tuned using the FER-2013 dataset discussed in an earlier section. To reiterate, the dataset contains 35,887 grayscale images. 28,709 are used for training, 3,589 are used for validation, and 3,589 are used for testing. There are seven emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral, though the number of samples varies significantly between classes. Even though the images from FER-2013 are 48x48, they are resized to 224x224 to fit the expected input size of ConvNeXt.</p>

<p>For training, the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4 was used in conjunction with a cosine delay schedule. Random crops and random rotation were applied to the training data. Stochastic depth (randomly removing residual blocks) and label smoothing (adding noise to ground truth label) were used for regularization. Weights are updated using an exponential moving average technique, which reduces overfitting by smoothing out weight updates.</p>

<p>Additionally, the authors employed Mixed Precision Training, which uses both 16-bit and 32-bit floating point numbers, thus reducing memory consumption and accelerating training. The model weights and optimizer state are stored using 32 bits, but the technique attempts to use 16-bit floating points when possible, such as during the forward pass and gradient calculations. Note that loss scaling is required, where gradients are multiplied by a large factor before backpropagation to prevent small gradients from underflowing in the FP16 format. The gradients are later scaled back down before updating the FP32 master weights.</p>

<p>All five sizes (T, S, B, L, and XL) of both ConvNeXt and EmoNeXt were trained using an Nvidia T4 GPU (16GB VRAM).</p>

<p>The EmoNeXt models considerably outperform their ConvNeXt counterparts, and the EmoNeXt-XLarge model achieves state of the art accuracy on FER-2013. Predictably, accuracy increases with model size. However, EmoNeXt-Small is especially notable because it has a notable jump in performance with EmoNeXt-Tiny, while only slightly falling behind EmoNeXt-Base.  It also surpasses Residual Masking Network and LHC-NetC, which are larger models.</p>

<h4 id="49-pros-and-cons">4.9. Pros and Cons</h4>

<p>The EmoNeXt framework, while complex, provides significant advantages for Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) compared to existing models, primarily due to its specialized architectural components.</p>

<p>A key strength is its classification accuracy, with the EmoNeXt-XLarge model achieving 76.12% accuracy on the FER2013 test set, a score that surpasses the current best state-of-the-art single network architecture, the Segmentation VGG-19 model (75.97%). Even the smaller EmoNeXt-Tiny and EmoNeXt-Small variants, achieving 73.34% and 74.33% accuracy, respectively, demonstrated superior performance compared to well-known models like ResNet50 and the original ConvNeXt counterparts.</p>

<p>Despite this great accuracy, EmoNeXt faces several limitations, largely tied to its data environment and size requirements for peak performance. For example, due to the highly unbalanced distribution of classes present in the FER2013 dataset, the model is heavily reliant on it for training and evaluation. Specifically the EmoNeXt-XLarge configuration is often necessary to reach high levels of accuracy.</p>

<p>Given that larger versions of ConvNeXt involve greater numbers of channels and blocks, these high-performing models likely entail substantial computational resource requirements. Additionally, the architecture is very complex, combining the ConvNeXt base with STN, SE blocks, and SA regularization. This intricacy makes the system much more complex than a standard convolutional network.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="5-comparison">5. Comparison</h3>

<h4 id="51-architecture">5.1. Architecture</h4>

<p>ResFace and EmoNeXt adopt fundamentally different architectural designs for facial emotion recognition. ResFace is built on a traditional ResNet backbone and adds modules that directly address known challenges in FER, such as emotional ambiguity, occlusion, and pose variation. Its design focuses on local feature extraction followed by attention-based channel-spatial aggregation, and it introduces a parallel compact feature aggregation branch that is dedicated to Label Distribution Learning (LDL). This design allows ResFace to model an emotion by predicting probability distributions rather than relying solely on a single hard class label. This makes it well-suited for datasets with subjective or ambiguous emotions.</p>

<p>In contrast, EmoNeXt is based on the ConvNeXt architecture, a modern convolutional model inspired by Vision Transformers. Rather than introducing an external teacher network like in ResFace, EmoNeXt integrates multiple feature-enhancing components directly into the backbone. These include a Spatial Transformer Network (STN), placed at the very beginning of the network to normalize geometric variations in facial images. It also includes Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, which are inserted after every ConvNeXt stage to recalibrate channel-wise feature importance and to add a self-attention regularization term, encouraging compact and balanced feature representations during training. Unlike ResFace, EmoNeXt relies on standard single-label classification and does not explicitly model emotion ambiguity through label distributions. Instead, it emphasizes stronger feature learning through attention, normalization, and regularization within the backbone itself.</p>

<p>Overall, ResFace introduces complexity through parallel learning objectives and distribution-based supervision, while EmoNeXt increases complexity within the backbone by stacking multiple advanced modules on top of ConvNext.</p>

<h4 id="52-efficiency">5.2. Efficiency</h4>

<p>From an efficiency perspective, ResFace is designed to achieve strong performance with relatively lightweight models. The authors demonstrate that even the ResNet-18 variant performs competitively, containing approximately 10.4 million parameters, while the ResNet-50 version remains compact at around 12.4 million parameters and around 2,000 MFLOPs. Although ResFace introduces additional modules such as the LDG during training, this teacher network is removed during inference, meaning it does not add overhead to the deployed model. As a result, ResFace has low computational cost while benefiting from label distribution learning.</p>

<p>EmoNeXt, on the other hand, tends to be more computationally demanding, specifically for its higher-performing variants. While smaller versions such as EmoNeXt-Tiny and EmoNeXt-Small already outperform several baseline models, the highest accuracy is achieved by EmoNeXt-Xlarge. This implies significantly higher computational and memory requirements compared to ResFace’s lightweight ResNet-based versions. EmoNeXt employs mixed precision training and exponential moving average (EMA) optimization techniques to reduce GPU memory usage and stabilize training. Even with these optimizations, EmoNeXt prioritizes representational power over efficiency, making it more resource-intensive than ResFace.</p>

<h4 id="53-performance">5.3. Performance</h4>

<p>In terms of performance, both models achieve strong results within their respective evaluation settings. ResFace is evaluated on FER+ and RAF-DB, datasets that feature refined annotated labels. On FER+, ResFace achieves accuracies of 89.87% with ResNet-50 and 87.89% with the lightweight ResNet-18 variant, demonstrating both high accuracy and efficiency. On RAF-DB, the ResNet-50 version reaches 88.38%, outperforming many existing FER approaches while maintaining efficiency.</p>

<p>EmoNeXt is evaluated on the original FER2013 dataset, which is known for noisy annotations and class imbalance. Under these more challenging conditions, EmoNeXt-XLarge achieves 76.12% accuracy, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art Segmentation VGG-19 model. Even the EmoNeXt-Tiny variant achieves 73.34%, outperforming standard CNN-based methods on the same dataset. While EmoNeXt’s raw accuracy scores are lower than those achieved by ResFace, this difference highly reflects dataset difficulty rather than model capability.</p>

<p>In summary, ResFace excels in scenarios with prevalent emotional ambiguity and mixed expressions, leveraging label distribution learning to model these states. EmoNeXt, by contrast, demonstrates strong utility for misalignment, rotation, and scale variation through spatial transformations and backbone-level attention mechanisms. Both models represent state-of-the-art solutions, optimized for different challenges within facial expression recognition.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="6-conclusion">6. Conclusion</h3>

<p>The objective of this technical report was to analyze modern Deep Learning (DL) approaches designed to improve Facial Emotion Recognition (FER), a task considered fundamental to effective social interactions and necessary for applications across fields like healthcare and human-computer interaction. We primarily focused on methods evaluated using the FER2013 dataset, which serves as a widely recognized but inherently challenging benchmark due to its size, poor label quality, and significant class imbalance. Specifically, we detailed the motivation, architecture, and performance of two contemporary frameworks: ResFace and EmoNeXt. ResFace addressed the subjective and ambiguous nature of real-world expressions by employing Label Distribution Learning (LDL), which supervises the network using a probability distribution over emotion categories rather than a single hard label. Conversely, the EmoNeXt framework, built on an adapted ConvNeXt architecture, focused on achieving state-of-the-art accuracy by integrating specialized modules like the Spatial Transformer Network (STN) to automatically handle spatial variations, and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks for adaptive channel-wise feature recalibration.</p>

<p>The most difficult challenge identified across modern FER research is fundamentally tied to data quality and distribution. Foundational datasets like FER2013 are plagued by defects, including misclassified images and highly unbalanced distributions across emotion categories, which dramatically impede a model’s ability to generalize effectively. Furthermore, achieving the highest performance levels necessitates increasingly complex DL models, such as the EmoNeXt-XLarge or EfficientNetB7 configurations. These large-scale models place severe demands on computational resources, often leading to limitations in GPU memory and maximum continuous execution time during the training process. Beyond data quality, models must also robustly extract discriminative features from faces despite real-world noise sources like pose variations, partial occlusion, and variations in scale.</p>

<p>Based on the demonstrated performance of complex architectures and the critical role of data preparation, we predict that the best future models will emerge from combining enhanced, diverse datasets with the next generation of powerful feature extractors. While EmoNeXt showed that advanced CNNs can compete with state-of-the-art Vision Transformers, the continued exploration of pure Transformer or hybrid models combined with vastly superior, defect-free datasets would maximize the architecture’s ability to capture the subtle, fine-grained emotional feature embeddings needed to truly master complex FER tasks.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>In recent years the field of computer vision has undergone several shifts in the primary paradigms used to define and train models. Before convolutional layers were introduced and widely adopted, most SOTA (state of the art) approaches relied on MLPs (multi-layer perceptrons). These models faced several challenges. At the time, memory and compute constraints were far more stringent than they are today, and the dense nature of MLPs created issues with training feasibility. A naive classifier for a \(32 \times 32 \times 3\) image would require an input layer with \(3072\) units, which is compute-intensive and was not scalable to large amounts of data.</p>

<p>These limitations contributed to convolutional networks becoming the dominant paradigm for computer vision [1,2]. Convolutions preserve the locality of visual information while allowing models to reach meaningful depth with far fewer parameters. Additionally, the CPU-bound nature of convolutions made them more suitable for older hardware than MLPs. Once convolutional networks became dominant, significant engineering effort went into improving these architectures. The residual connection, Adam optimizer, pruning methods, and many other techniques were originally introduced and tested in the context of convolutional networks [3–5].
More recently, transformers have become dominant because they capture global relationships more effectively and benefit from dense matrix operations [6,7]. With the introduction of the Vision Transformer, many methods previously developed for computer vision, as well as a subset of methods from NLP (natural language processing), have been adopted to achieve superior performance [6,7]. Even though some edge-device use cases still rely on convolutions to achieve the best performance, the state-of-the-art has shifted toward transformers [6,7].
Parallel to the rise of transformers, we have seen an increased abundance of cheap and capable compute resources. Over the past 10 years, at the consumer price range, available VRAM has more than doubled while processing speed at full precision has increased more than fourfold. However, this does not even begin to capture the large gains in mixed- and lower-precision processing. At the datacenter level, the NVIDIA Tesla K80, the SOTA GPU in 2015, had an FP32 processing speed of roughly 8.7 TFLOPs, while a modern NVIDIA H100 reaches over 1,900 TFLOPs at FP16.</p>

<p>This progress raises an important question: as modern hardware is optimized for large dense matrix multiplications and compute constraints are less restrictive, can MLPs once again serve as competitive vision architectures that provide superior performance to convolutional layers and faster inference than transformers? Recent work on all-MLP architectures and surveys of visual MLPs suggests that this may be possible [8,9].</p>

<p>The thesis of this paper is that MLP-based architectures can achieve near state-of-the-art performance while aligning more naturally with modern hardware acceleration than either transformers or convolutions [8,9].</p>

<p>The remainder of this paper presents three important works demonstrating the potential of MLP-based approaches to computer vision and discusses the similarities, differences, and potential of each approach.</p>

<h2 id="2-overview-of-selected-papers">2. Overview of Selected Papers</h2>

<p>In this section we will present a set of three papers that we feel are representative of the base ideas being explored in the research regarding modern MLP-based architectures for computer vision. We present different approaches to the same basic problem of formulating a dense processing module for an image, and the different problems that come with the approaches. These include getting locality through patching or shifting images, mixing information between patches or between rows and columns of the image, and more.</p>

<h3 id="21-paper-1-mlp-mixer-an-all-mlp-architecture-for-vision">2.1 Paper 1: MLP-Mixer: An all-MLP Architecture for Vision</h3>

<p>The MLP-Mixer paper challenges the assumption that modern computer vision must rely on convolutions (CNNs) or attention mechanisms (ViTs). Instead, the authors proposed an idea of using an architecture that is exclusively based on MLPs, the MLP-Mixer. An MLP-Mixer block contains two types of layers. The first is applied independently to image patches in order to “mix” information across feature channels within each patch. The second is applied across patches to “mix” spatial information, which enables local patch information to be propagated globally within an image.</p>

<p style="&quot;width: 1600px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team_4/figure1.png" alt="YOLO" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <caption>Figure 1. MLP-Mixer Architecture [8]</caption></p>

<p>Figure 1 shows a schematic view of the MLP Mixer block, which is the main building block of the architecture. The input data for a MLP mixer has size \(P \times C\), where \(P\) is the number of patches and \(C\) is the number of channels per patch, effectively acting as a sequence of tokens. The input is first normalized through a layernorm, and then it is transposed to get a \(C \times P\) view of the data. Then the data is processed through an MLP, with the C dimension acting as a batch dimension for the purposes of the MLP. The MLP itself consists of two fully connected layers with a hidden size dependent on the size of the MLP Mixer instance and a GELU activation function. Once we get the output of the MLP block, we have a tensor where the information contained across patches corresponding to the same channel has been mixed. After this we transpose the inputs again to get back to the original \(P \times C\) size, and push them through another MLP with a similar architecture to the first one. At the end of this whole process we get back an output tensor of data with the same size as the input but with information propagated both across channels and across patches at a cost trivial in comparison to what it would be if we used a flattened image as the input to a fully connected layer.</p>

<p>A typical configuration such as Mixer-B/16 contains 12 MLP blocks with patch resolution 16x16. The model takes 224x224 RGB images and splits them into 196 patches. Mixer-B/16 contains about 59 million parameters and achieves a throughput of 1384 images/sec/core using TPUv3, making it slightly faster than ViT-B/16 (with 861 image/sec/core using TPUv3).</p>

<p style="&quot;width: 1600px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team_4/figure2.png" alt="YOLO" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <caption>Figure 2. MLP-Mixer Configurations [8]</caption></p>

<p>When trained with large datasets and proper regularization, MLP-Mixer attains competitive performance on image classification benchmarks while keeping pre-training and inference cost comparable to state-of-the-art models. For example, when Mixer-B/16 and ViT-B/16 models were both pre-trained for 300 epochs, the ImageNet top-1 accuracy for Mixer-B/16 (76.44%) was comparable to ViT-B/16 accuracy (79.67%).</p>

<p>Additionally, an important factor in deciding what model to use is the scalability of the model with respect to increasing amounts of training data. The authors found that the MLP-Mixer has comparable performance to ViT as training data increases.</p>

<p style="&quot;width: 1600px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team_4/figure3.png" alt="YOLO" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <caption>Figure 3. MLP-Mixer Scaling Laws [8]</caption></p>

<p>This paper suggests that neither convolution nor attention mechanisms are necessary to attain high performance on image classification problems. An architecture composed entirely of MLP layers can still sufficiently learn a rich feature space.</p>

<h3 id="22-paper-2-caterpillar-a-pure-mlp-architecture-with-shifted-pillars-concatenation">2.2 Paper 2: Caterpillar: A Pure-MLP Architecture with Shifted-Pillars-Concatenation</h3>

<p>This paper introduces the Caterpillar architecture for computer vision tasks. The main aim is to take existing SOTA work in MLP-based architectures while reintroducing the spatial locality information that convolutions provide. To this end, the paper combines an existing MLP-based architecture, the sMLP, with a novel idea on how to inject locality. Locality is injected through a Shifted-Pillars-Concatenation (SPC) module, which acts as both a processing layer and a locality-inducing layer for the model.</p>

<p>The sMLP block is an architectural building block that was first introduced by Tang et al. The main idea of this block is that, instead of patching, we can use information from the row and column of a given pixel to get a better view of the context in which that pixel operates. As such, given some input tensor \(X\) with shape \(H \times W\), for each pixel at its corresponding row and columns, we project them through linear weights and concatenate them with the original pixel. The pseudocode for this operation is given by:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>proj_h = nn.Linear(H, H)
proj_w = nn.Linear(W, W)
fuse = nn.Linear(3C, C)
def sparse_mlp(x):
    x_h = self.proj_h(x.permute(2,1,0)).permute(2,1,0)
    x_w = self.proj_w(x.permute(0,2,1)).permute(0,2,1)
    x = torch.concat([x_h, x_w, x], dim=2)
    x = self.fuse(x)
    return x
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The sMLP block is a lot more parameter efficient than the naive MLP approach, scaling with \(N^{3/2}\) of the number of patches that we would find in an image.</p>

<p>The original paper introducing this block later goes on to augment it with a convolutional layer, introducing an inefficient processing step into the architecture. The Caterpillar paper aims to replace the convolutional layer with an MLP for a pure-MLP architecture. However, the original reason for why the MLP was introduced was to enrich the pixels with local information surrounding the pixel that is not present in its corresponding row and column. To this end, the paper introduces the SPC module.</p>

<p>The SPC module operates on a very simple idea. We can include local information surrounding a pixel in a parallelizable way by shifting the whole image by one pixel in all four directions and concatenating the pixel values from each direction into a single channel. The logic is as follows: an image of shape \(H \times W \times C\) is taken and shifted into the direction that we want to capture. We can shift every pixel up, down, left, and right depending on which direction we need. After shifting, we have to pad the image in the newly opened row or column so we still have an \(H \times W \times C\) image. Thus, we get four shifted versions of the image: \(X_u\), \(X_d\), \(X_l\), \(X_r\).</p>

<p style="&quot;width: 1600px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team_4/figure4.png" alt="YOLO" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <caption>Figure 4. SPC Schematic [10]</caption></p>

<p>The next processing step is projecting each of these with a matrix multiplication using the corresponding learned matrix \(W_u\), \(W_d\), \(W_l\), or \(W_r\). Thus, the final output of the SPC module is given by the expression:</p>

\[\text{SPC}(X) = \text{Concat}(X_uW_u, X_dW_d, X_lW_l, X_rW_r)W\]

<p>where \(W\) is a final projection mixing information from every shifted image.</p>

<p>Thus, a single Caterpillar block is given by a sequence of BatchNorm, GeLU, SPC, BatchNorm, GeLU, sMLP, LinearNorm, and MLP. The Caterpillar architecture stacks these blocks together and finally feeds the output into a classification head.</p>

<p>The Caterpillar architecture shows that a pure-MLP design with SPC-based locality can match or surpass strong convolutional, transformer, and hybrid baselines on both small- and large-scale benchmarks. However, the most interesting evaluation shown by the authors was in taking the standard ResNet architecture and swapping out convolutions with SPC blocks. This yielded up to a 4.7% performance improvement for a ResNet-18-style architecture, showing that the MLP-only architecture is capable of fully replacing and outperforming convolutions at similar sizes.</p>

<h3 id="23-paper-3-resmlp-feedforward-networks-for-image-classification-with-data-efficient-training">2.3 Paper 3: ResMLP: Feedforward networks for image classification with data-efficient training</h3>

<p>ResMLP is an architecture that is built entirely based on MLPs. ResMLP contains two blocks, the cross-patch sublayer and cross-channel sublayer. The cross-patch linear layer is applied to all channels independently, to mix across patches. The cross-channel sublayer is applied independently to all patches, to mix information locally.</p>

<p style="&quot;width: 1600px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team_4/figure5.png" alt="YOLO" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <caption>Figure 5. ResMLP Block [11]</caption></p>

<p>In ResMLP, images are first split into \(N \times N\) non-overlapping patches (usually 16x16). The patches are independently passed through a linear layer to form a set of \(N^2\) \(d\)-dimensional embeddings. These embeddings are passed into the ResMLP layer. Each sublayer of the ResMLP layer runs in parallel with a residual connection. The first step is an Affine transformation defined by:</p>

\[\text{Aff}_{\alpha, \beta}(x) = \text{Diag}(\alpha)x + \beta\]

<p>Where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are learnable weight vectors. The embeddings are then passed into a linear layer after transposing to mix across patches. It is transposed back to receive the original shape before the first affine transformation, and fed into a different affine transformation. The affine transformation at the beginning (pre-normalization) is initialized with \(\alpha = 1\) and \(\beta = 0\). The affine transformation at the end of the residual block (post-normalization) is initialized with a small \(\alpha\) value. These embeddings are recombined with its residual connection and fed into the cross-channel sublayer. The cross-channel sublayer follows a similar layout with affine transformations in the beginning and end of the sublayer. In the middle, two linear layers separated by GeLU activation function are present. Lastly an average pooling is done the d-dimensional patches and fed into a linear classifier to predict a label associated with the image. The ResMLP Layer can be described by the following:</p>

\[Z = X + \text{Aff}((A \cdot \text{Aff}(X)^T)^T)\]

\[Y = Z + \text{Aff}(C \cdot \text{GeLU}(B \cdot \text{Aff}(Z)))\]

<p>where \(A\), \(B\), \(C\) are learnable weight matrices.
One baseline model is the ResMLP-S12 model. It contains 12 ResMLP blocks with patch resolution \(16 \times 16\). The model takes \(224 \times 224\) RGB with hidden dimension \(384\). This model takes 1.54 million parameters and has a throughput of 1415.1 image/sec, where DeiT-S had a throughput of 940.4 images/sec when trained on a single V100-32GB GPU with batch size of \(32\).</p>

<p>ResMLP attains similar accuracy to Transformers and Convolution networks. For example, when ResMLP-S12, EfficientNet-B3, and DeiT-S models were pre-trained on ImageNet, top-1 accuracy for ResMLP-S12 (76.6%) came very close to both EfficientNet-B3 accuracy (81.1%) and DeiT-S accuracy (79.8%).</p>

<p>The ResMLP architecture demonstrates that a purely MLP design using the combination of residual connections and affine transformations can reach SOTA performance with significantly higher throughput.</p>

<h2 id="methodology-comparison">Methodology Comparison</h2>

<h3 id="31-structural-approaches-to-mixing-information">3.1 Structural Approaches to “Mixing” Information</h3>

<p>The three papers that we presented all try to grapple with the problem of inductive bias when working with image data. Convolutions, even though they may be computationally inefficient, have a very strong inductive bias towards locality. Locality is a very useful inductive bias for image data, so adding it into a model architecture is a central problem in designing models for computer vision. MLPs do not natively have any kind of inductive bias, so the presented papers all try to introduce locality bias to reach SOTA performance as well as get the improved computational efficiency of MLPs.</p>

<p>The MLP mixer and ResMLP models have locality built into them through the per-patch MLP processing. These models have a \(P \times C\) shaped input, where \(P\) is the number of patches and \(C\) is the number of channels per patch. When we run this input through an MLP across the \(P\) dimension, the MLP processes each patch individually, meaning it sees all the local information in the patch. This process introduces strong inductive bias towards locality.</p>

<p>The Caterpillar model has a different approach. The original paper introducing Caterpillar’s main MLP module, the sMLP, used convolutions in their main processing block to introduce locality. However, the Caterpillar models use a shifted pillars concatenation method, which takes each pixel’s neighbors and concatenates all of the data contained within those neighbors into a single local feature. This is then processed by the sparse MLP, which now sees local information surrounding each pixel.</p>

<h3 id="32-model-architectures-and-dimensionality">3.2 Model Architectures and Dimensionality</h3>

<p>The three presented models all approach the data processing from different sides. The MLP-Mixer model treats input images as sequences of tokens, whereas the Caterpillar model has a different approach that focuses on modifying the content of pixels inside a feature map through shifting, padding, and looking at rows and columns of the feature map.</p>

<p>These models also take different approaches to normalization. MLP-Mixer utilizes Layer Norms for normalization before every mixing step. The ResMLP model takes this a step further, by introducing a special learned affine transformation both as a pre and post normalization to manage the signal propagation through the network without using BatchNorm or LayerNorm in its computational blocks. The Caterpillar model uses BatchNorm combined with GeLU activation in its own block structure. Thus, each of these models have a unique way of normalizing the inputs to their processing blocks to manage how well gradients can propagate and data can be processed inside them.</p>

<p>The models also take different approaches when it comes to the reduction and expansion of the representation of its input data. MLP-Mixer and ResMLP patch the input images and run their respective MLPs across the resized data while keeping the overall size constant throughout the process. Caterpillar projects the shifted pixel data it creates via matrix multiplication thus in some way having a similar idea to the channels of convolutional layers.</p>

<h3 id="33-training-strategies--datasets">3.3 Training Strategies &amp; Datasets</h3>

<p>The MLP-Mixer model requires large datasets and regularization to learn, reminiscent of transformer models. Also similarly to transformer models, it has been shown to scale linearly with data volume, tracking ViTs very closely in performance vs data graphs.</p>

<p>The ResMLP was explicitly designed to be as data-efficient as possible, utilizing specific initializations for both their MLPs and their affine transformation to make gradient flows stable and efficient.</p>

<h3 id="34-evaluation-metrics">3.4 Evaluation Metrics</h3>

<p>The promise of MLP based models is that they could harness the efficiency of large parallelized matrix multiplications, while not compromising on model performance. Thus, the metrics presented in the papers as well as the metrics we focus on in this literature review are the throughput/inference speed and accuracy, with accuracy being important but somewhat secondary to throughput as long as it is at a similar level to the SOTA.</p>

<p>All of the presented models have been shown to be able to reach near-SOTA performance at much lower processing cost and much higher throughput. MLP-Mixer B/16 is able to process over 1300 images per second per core on the TPUv3 hardware, compared to the 280 images per second per core for the ViT model, at only 5% less accuracy for ImageNet. ResMLP also shows this extremely high computational efficiency, reaching over 1400 images per second on the V100 GPU. These performance numbers are a function of MLPs being able to utilize the hardware acceleration focus of GPUs on matrix multiplication, allowing them to reach much closer to the peak FLOPs of the utilized hardware than convolution based networks. Thus, all the models presented here have shown that one could harness both computational advantages of the MLP as well as get high accuracy on the modeling tasks.</p>

<h2 id="4-results-and-performance-comparison">4. Results and Performance Comparison</h2>

<h3 id="41-accuracy-against-sota-baselines">4.1 Accuracy against SOTA Baselines</h3>

<p>Results for the MLP-Mixer model, especially when compared with the Vision Transformer, indicate that the MLP architecture can achieve accuracy comparable to the attention-based models while being significantly faster. The Mixer-B/16 model was trained to match the ViT-B/16 model’s 300 epochs of pre-training, with the MLP-Mixer achieving a 76.44% accuracy. This is competitive but slightly lower than the accuracy achieved by the ViT, which was 79.67%. This suggests that the ViT adds some inductive biases through the attention mechanism that are not present in the MLP-mixer’s approach.</p>

<p>The ResMLP model shows a similar trend. The ResMLP-S12 model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 76.6% on ImageNet, which brings it close to the convolution-based EfficientNet-B3 and transformer-based DeiT-S models. One thing that we must remember, however, is that the convolution and transformer models are highly optimized and engineered, making the near-SOTA performance of the MLP based model more encouraging. This is achieved while being faster than both the EfficientNet and DeiT models.</p>

<p>The Caterpillar model measures a very interesting effect. One question asked by the paper is, what if we took an existing convolution based model and swapped out the convolution for a MLP-based module. The Caterpillar work modified the ResNet-18 architecture with their shifted pillars concatenation blocks to observe the performance change with respect to the original ResNet-18. The modification resulted in a performance improvement of up to 4.7%. This gain highlights the potential of the SPC module as a pure MLP-based module to introduce important inductive biases into architectures while still harnessing the computational efficiency of large matrix multiplications.</p>

<h3 id="42-computational-efficiency-and-hardware-alignment">4.2 Computational Efficiency and Hardware Alignment</h3>

<p>As we stated earlier, accuracy is not the only metric that we would like to address here. An arguably more important metric for the purposes of this analysis is the computational efficiency of the models. Here, MLP-based architectures have a clear advantage due to their structure. For example, the Mixer-B/16 model achieved a throughput of 1384 images per second per core on the TPUv3. This can be compared to the ViT-B/16 model which has a processing speed that is 38% slower. This efficiency gap generalizes to the ResMLP architecture, where the ResMLP-S12 achieves a throughput speed that is over 30% faster than the DeiT-S model on the V100 GPU. These metrics show what we posited originally, that the hardware architecture of GPUs and TPUs, as well as the amount of optimization that goes into matrix multiplication, makes MLPs a clear advantage in speed.</p>

<p>This advantage in speed is also easier to scale through optimization. The current hardware architectures lend themselves very easily to multi-precision processing. Matrix multiplication is one of the easiest operations to implement for native INT8 and FP4 precisions, which makes both the processing time more than double, and the memory movements of the large matrices significantly faster. Thus, MLPs being an architecture that uses matrix multiplication very heavily, makes them perfect for fast inference and efficient training, especially compared to convolutions.</p>

<h2 id="5-cross-paper-analysis">5. Cross-Paper Analysis</h2>

<p>One of the implied consequences of the MLP-based approach to modeling is the rejection of the large importance of inductive bias. This includes both the local inductive bias of convolutions, and global inductive bias of transformers. Each architecture is built mostly on the premise that a rich feature space can be learned through matrix multiplications without large inductive biases. Of course, this conclusion is limited to an extent by the architecture of the models, which in all three cases attempts to encode some inductive biases through either the approach to patch processing for MLP-Mixer and ResMLP, or the SPC module for the Caterpillar model. Regardless, however, the inductive bias introduced by these techniques are significantly less strong than those encoded in transformers and convolutions.</p>

<p>The different attempts to encode said inductive biases have some interesting differences as well as similarities between the models. The MLP-Mixer and ResMLP models approach locality through mixing local information within patches with global information across patches. The ResMLP model additionally utilizes the affine transformation to handle signal propagation through this locality-inducing operation. The Caterpillar model approaches locality very differently. There is no patching for the Caterpillar model, but rather explicit locality introduced through features from spatial neighbors of a given pixel being concatenated together into a single feature vector. While this seems to be a very explicit inclusion of locality as inductive bias, it is not nearly as strong as the inductive bias encoded in convolutional layers. Thus the three models reject strong inductive biases in favor of weaker biases coupled with dense matrix multiplications as the primary modeling approach. While this gets the models most of the way to SOTA performance, some gains are still required to show complete equivalence of performance to current SOTA approaches with stronger inductive biases.</p>

<p>These differences in approach are, mostly, orthogonal to each other. As shown by Caterpillar, one can get large performance gains through adding SPC based modules to existing models like the ResNet-18. This suggests that integrating an SPC-like method into the MLP-Mixer or ResMLP could lead to performance superior to the original models. Additionally, the insight gained through ResMLP’s use of affine transformations in place of normalization is also possible to leverage in designing MLP based models. In principle, the affine transformation can be simply put into place instead of BatchNorm or LayerNorm in the other models. Finally, it is important to recognize the differences in scale in these models. The ResMLP model is a highly parameter-efficient model, showing that MLP based models can achieve good performance with few parameters. In contrast, MLP-Mixer shows that MLPs can scale at least as well as vision transformers with the amount of data, training compute, and number of parameters.</p>

<h2 id="6-conclusion">6. Conclusion</h2>

<p>This literature review explored three MLP-based architectures, the MLP-Mixer, ResMLP, and Caterpillar. The aim of the review was to show that MLP-based architectures can reach near-SOTA performance, while having more efficient hardware utilization and faster inference. This thesis is largely supported by the data found in the papers.</p>

<p>The presented methods reach accuracies on ImageNet that are within 5% of comparable-sized SOTA models, and within 10% of overall SOTA. The MLP-Mixer model achieves an accuracy of over 76% on ImageNet, compared to similarly sized ViT-B’s 79%. This shows the accuracy part of our thesis to be valid. Additionally, the authors report an over 30% increase in throughput compared to the same model, showing that the theoretical performance gains that come with such a matrix multiplication heavy model can materialize into large actual speedups.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The core of computer vision for robotics is utilizing deep learning to allow robots to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world. However, training models to understand the physical world has proven to be extremely difficult, with issues stemming from the lack of training embodied data (robot centric videos, human interactions in tasks). Models also struggle with relating semantic information to the physical world to conduct actions and generalizing or extending to new environments. Vision language action models recently emerged at the forefront of end-to-end models handling visual input, language instruction, and outputting robot actions.</p>

<h2 id="background-on-vlas">Background on VLAs</h2>

<p>Various models typically utilized at most two of these three components: vision, language and action. For example R3M which is a universal visual representation utilizing video and language during training, but only serves as a backbone and relies on training a separate downstream policy for robot action. Another example is Track2Act, which utilizes Vision and Action, with 2D track predictions for trajectories of objects without language/explicit goal set.</p>

<p>Vision Language Action models utilize all 3 in a multimodal pipeline, to concurrently process image/video + language (captions) to output a robot action. Drawing inspiration from transformers, VLA models use a fine tuned vision language model to output actions instead of text answers. In this report, we discuss and compare RT-2 (55B param), OpenVLA (7B param) which use vision language backbones, with Octo, a compact (93M param) generalist robot policy that omits a vision language backbone.</p>

<h2 id="rt-2-google-deepmind">RT-2 (Google Deepmind)</h2>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>RT-2 was the first model to indicate success with using pretrained vision language models to directly output robot actions. RT-2 utilized PaLI-X (larger model, overall better performance) and PaLM-E (smaller, performed better on math reasoning) for its backbone. Building on its predecessor, RT-1, which directly trained on robot data, RT-2 draws inspiration from RT-1 on the concept of discretization of action as tokens, demonstrating that robot action can be represented similarly to how VLMs tokenize and process natural language for generation.</p>

<h4 id="vision-encoder">Vision Encoder:</h4>

<p>Processes robot camera images into patch embeddings (e.g., 16×16 pixel patches)

Pretrained on web-scale image data</p>

<h4 id="language-model-backbone">Language Model Backbone:</h4>

<p>For PaLI-X, the projected image tokens and text tokens are jointly fed into encoder, and the decoder autoregressively generates output
For PaLM-E, projected image tokens are concatenated directly with the text tokens, decoder processes the combined stream
Pretrained on web-scale vision-language tasks</p>

<h3 id="tokenization-method-and-action-output">Tokenization Method and Action Output</h3>

<p>Drawing inspiration from discrete representations for action encodings in RT-1, RT-2 represents the range of motion, into 256 distinct steps, otherwise known as bins. The action space consists of 8 dimensions (6 positional, rotational displacement, extension of gripper, command for termination) are discretized into 256 bins uniformly excluding the termination command. These 256 action bins are mapped to existing tokens in the VLM’s token vocabulary. For example “128” could represent a quantity of speed, so when processing an instruction like “put the apple down” the VLM would output a string of 8 discrete tokens per timestep (e.g.”1 128 91 241 5 101 127 217”). This allows the model to be trained using the standard categorical cross-entropy loss used for text generation, without adding new “action heads” or changing the model architecture.</p>

<h3 id="training-for-next-token-generation">Training for Next Token Generation</h3>

<p>Utilized co-fine-tuning strategy where training batches mix original web data along with robot data for more generalizable policies since it exposes the policy to abstract visual concepts from web data and low level robot actions, instead of just robot actions like in RT-1. Vision language data comes from WebLI dataset, consisting of ~10 billion image-text pairs across 109 languages, filtered down to the top 10% (1 billion examples) based on cross-modal similarity.</p>

<p>Robotics data comes from RT-1 dataset (Brohan et al., 2022), which includes demonstration episodes collected on a mobile manipulator. These episodes are annotated with natural language instructions covering seven core skills: “Pick Object,” “Move Object Near Object,” “Place Object Upright,” “Knock Object Over,” “Open Drawer,” “Close Drawer,” and “Place Object into Receptacle”.</p>

<h3 id="overview-1">Overview</h3>

<p>OpenVLA is an open-source alternative to RT-2, employs the same architectural structure, utilizing a VLM backbone repurposed to handle action tokens, but at a smaller scale. However, notable differences include training purely on the Open-X-Embodiment dataset which contains 1.3M robot trajectories, utilizing a duel vision encoder structure to capture spatial features. OpenVLA also explores fine-tuning strategies for it’s components unlike RT-2, which kept the backbone pretrained weights frozen.</p>

<p>OpenVLA adopts RT-2’s “action-as-language” strategy of discretizing dimensions of robot actions into 256 bins. Since Llama’s tokenizer only reserves 100 “special” tokens, the authors chose to override the 256 least used tokens in the vocabulary for simplicity.</p>

<p>Authors attributed increases in performance to fine-tuning the vision encoder, which captures more fine-grained spatial details about scenes for precise robotic control.

<h2 id="octo-uc-berkeley">Octo (UC Berkeley)</h2>

<h3 id="overview-2">Overview</h3>

<p>Octo is an open-source Generalist Robot Policy with a fundamentally different approach from VLAs like RT-2. Rather than adapting a massive pretrained VLM, Octo is trained from scratch as a compact transformer designed specifically for robot action. Octo aims to address the flaws of large robot policies trained on diverse datasets such as constrained downstream policies (e.g. restrictive inputs from single camera view) and serve as a “true” general robot policy, allowing different camera configurations, different robots, language vs goal images, and new robot setups.</p>

  <li>Custom transformer (27M for Small, 93M for Base)</li>
  <li>Processes concatenated vision and language tokens</li>
  <li>Block-wise Attention Masking: Handles missing modalities (e.g., robots without wrist cameras) by masking specific input groups during training</li>
  <li>Trained from scratch on robot data (no web pretraining)</li>

<p><strong>Diffusion Action Head:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Replaces the language modeling head with a diffusion decoder</li>
  <li>Outputs continuous actions rather than discrete tokens</li>
  <li>Iteratively denoises Gaussian noise into precise action trajectories</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="action-representation-1">Action Representation</h3>

<p>Octo converts language instructions ℓ, goals g, and observation sequences o₁,…,oₕ into tokens [Tₗ, Tᵧ, Tₒ] using modality-specific tokenizers which are processed by the transformer backbone and fed into a readout head to output desired actions. The block-wise masking forces tokens to attend to tokens from same or earlier timesteps, and tokens corresponding to non-existing observations are completely masked to handle missing modalities. Unlike RT-2 and OpenVLA which discretize actions into tokens, Octo outputs continuous actions via diffusion, utilizing denoising for action decoding for the prediction of action “chunks” ( e.g., chunk of 4 timesteps).</p>

<h3 id="training-1">Training</h3>

<p>Unlike RT-2 and OpenVLA which fine-tune massive pretrained VLMs, Octo is trained entirely from scratch on robot data. This design choice trades web-scale semantic knowledge for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Faster training (14 hours vs. days/weeks for VLAs)</li>
  <li>Smaller compute requirements (single TPUv4-128 podvs. multi-pod setups)</li>
  <li>Full control over the learned representations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Dataset:</strong></p>

<p>800,000 trajectories from Open X-Embodiment dataset covering 9 distinct robot embodiments</p>

<p><strong>Training Details:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>AdamW optimizer, inverse square root learning rate decay</li>
  <li>Weight decay 0.1, gradient clipping 1.0</li>
  <li>300k steps, batch size 2048 on TPUv4-128 (~14 hours)</li>
</ul>

<p style="width: 800px; max-width: 100%;">Diffusion denoising process for action generation
<img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team05/Octo_denoising.png" alt="Octo Diffusion Denoising" /></p>

<p>The action head is trained with the standard denoising objective loss function:</p>

\[\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{t, x_0, \epsilon} \left[ \|\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)\|^2 \right]\]

<p>This trains the model to predict the noise \(\epsilon\) added to clean actions \(x_0\), enabling iterative denoising at inference time. The diffusion formulation for action generation is:</p>

\[X^{k+1} = \alpha X^k - \gamma \epsilon_\theta(X^k, e) + \sigma z\]

<p>where \(X^k\) is the result of the previous denoised stage of the action, \(k\) is the current denoising step, \(e\) is the output embedding from the transformer, and \(\alpha\), \(\gamma\), \(\sigma\) are hyperparameters for the noise schedule.</p>

<p><strong>Why Diffusion Over Alternatives:</strong></p>

<p>Simple MSE was also tried but didn’t perform as well since it incentivizes the robot to an “average” behavior, and can’t handle uncertainty or scenarios with multiple correct choices. Likewise, with discretization/cross-entropy, the robot was observed with less precision, moving to the nearest predefined bin. Diffusion treats actions as continuous values to retain precision and force the denoising process into a specific valid action.</p>

<h3 id="performance-vs-scale">Performance vs Scale</h3>

<p>The comparison of 3 models with various different parameter counts demonstrates that scaling parameter count alone doesn’t necessarily determine model performance the most, as architectural decisions and fine-tuning, and other strategies still play an important role. For leveled comparisons, since RT-2 is significantly larger and trained on a different dataset, comparisons are made against the RT-2-X model (trained on 350k trajectories in Open-X-Embodiment) so all 3 models use the same dataset. For example, in OpenVLA fine-tuning the weights in vision encoder portion and uses much more epochs, whereas RT-2 keeps the frozen weights in vision encoder, and although undisclosed, likely used significantly less epochs due to model size, yet Open-VLA on overall performed 20% better than RT-2-X. Another factor that could be considered between these two models was OpenVLA’s data curation strategy from the Open-X-Embodiment compared to RT-2’s co-mixing of robot and web scale data.</p>

<p style="width: 800px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team05/BridgeDataChart.png" alt="BridgeChart " /></p>
<p><em>Out-of-the-Box-Evals.</em></p>

<h3 id="discrete-tokens-for-actions-vs-continous-diffusion">Discrete Tokens for Actions vs Continous Diffusion</h3>

<p>The decision represents a tradeoff primarily between high-level semantic reasoning with a large vision language model backbone and precise low-level control with a diffusion policy. Octo was also evaluated using goal image conditioning and found it had 25% higher success rate than when being evaluated with language conditioning.</p>

<p style="width: 800px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team05/OctoCharts.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><em>Comparisons between Octo and other models.</em></p>

<p>Since RT-2-X is closed-source comparisons required a hybrid approach where RT-2-X metrics were directly sourced from literature, Octo’s authors collabed with Google Deepmind to run Octo on the RT-1 robot. Another factor is the evaluated tasks were seen during pre-training, which likely explains the strong performance here compared to RT-2-X compared to the out-of-the-box evaluations shown earlier. Regardless, Octo still demonstrates the ability of flexibility running on various different robots, as well as it’s efficiency with 93M params compared to 55B in RT-2-X.</p>

<h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>

<p>A key distinction between these models is accessibility. RT-2 remains closed-source
with no public weights, training code, or fine-tuning support—limiting its use to
Google’s internal research. On the other hand, OpenVLA and Octo released full model
weights, training pipelines, and fine-tuning scripts with public github repositories. OpenVLA additionally supports
LoRA fine-tuning on consumer GPUs (single RTX 4090) and 4-bit quantization for
deployment, reducing the barrier to entry for robotics researchers without
datacenter-scale compute.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

<p>For RT-2, despite incorporating web-scale data along with its robot data, it is still unable to learn any new motions and is limited to skills seen in the robot data, rather learning new ways to apply those skills. Computations in real-time inference can become a bottleneck due to the sheer size of the model and requires direct integration with TPU-specific hardware.</p>

<p>For OpenVLA, the authors discuss only being able to process single-image input, despite most modern robots having multiple camera views so surrounding spatial awareness is actually limited despite having Dinov2 as an additional image encoder. Inference time was another cited issue especially in high-frequency setups, same as RT-2. Both RT-2 and OpenVLA also share the issue of quantization error for extremely fine-grained and precise movements that can’t be represented in the 256 bins.</p>

<p>For Octo, the authors attributed issues to fine tuning due to the characteristics of training data, performing better in specific camera views despite being general purpose. As illustrated earlier, another limitation was it’s lack of semantioc reasoning capabilities that come from web-scale pretrained VLMs, greatly affecting its performance on language conditioned policy compared to goal conditioned policy.</p>

<p>Some shared limitations include all three models primarily being evaluated on tabletop manipulation with 7-DoF arms, but generalizations to other robot embodiments remains unexplored, (humanoids, quadrupeds, mobile manipulators)</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-camera-geometry-basics">Introduction to Camera Geometry Basics</h2>

<p>Camera geometry is necessary to map out the relationship between 3D points in the real world and the corresponding 2D projection which are pixel coordinates. There are a few technical terms we will use. First, the process of projecting 3D coordinates to 2D is typically modeled by the Pinhole Camera Model as shown in the figure below. This model describes the mathematical relationship of the projection where the pinhole is the center of projection and the origin of a Euclidean coordinate system and the Z axis is the image plane or focal plane [2.]</p>

<p style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team10/figure_1.png" alt="Figure 1" /></p>
<p>Figure 1. Pinhole Camera Model [1]</p>

<p>Second, we define world coordinates as representations of a location in the World Cartesian coordinate system. The 3D position of a point P in this world is set to P = (X, Y, Z). Second, camera coordinates represent the coordinate system in the virtual camera plane. The planes x and y are parallel to the world coordinates axes X and Y but run in opposite directions. The signs of the coordinates will stay the same meaning both images in the world and camera coordinates are identical except for a flip. Assuming the distance from the pinhole to the sensing plane is represented by f also known as the focal length, then we can define the following equations:</p>

<p style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team10/figure_2.png" alt="Figure 2" /></p>
<p>Figure 2. Perspective projection equations [1]</p>

<p>Based on the perspective projection equations which are from the notion of similar triangles, we can map the 3D point [X, Y, Z]T to the coordinates [x, y]T on the image plane. We also add a fourth coordinate to get P = (X, Y, Z, 1)T to get homogeneous coordinates. We can confirm that we get the perspective projection if we multiply P with the matrix K as shown below [2].</p>

<p style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team10/figure_3.png" alt="Figure 3" /></p>
<p>Figure 3. Perspective projection of 3D point p [1]</p>

<p>Then we can transform the homogeneous coordinates scaled by the camera’s focal length f to convert it to heterogeneous coordinates and divide by Z into 2D coordinates. As a result, the 2D projected coordinates can be labeled as p.</p>

<h2 id="structure-from-motion-overview">Structure-from-Motion Overview</h2>

<p>SfM is the geometric method of recovering the 3D structure and camera motion through a collection of images which addresses a fundamental problem in computer vision. SfMs are applied to novel view synthesis which generates images of a specific scene or subject from a certain point of view given that the only available information of the specific scene or subject is images taken from different points of view than the one we are trying to synthesize. SfMs are also used for cloud-based mapping and localization which involves using powerful cloud servers for generating dynamic mappings of surrounding environments often used for autonomous vehicles and robots.</p>

<p style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team10/figure_4.png" alt="Figure 4" /></p>
<p>Figure 4. Structure from Motion point cloud [4]</p>

<p>SfM works by analyzing how various points in the images shift and change relative to one another as the camera angle and position changes. This is typically done through motion parallax which reconstructs the scene or subject’s 3D structure and camera orientation and position for each image taken at different point of views. Going more in detail, the first step involves taking multiple overlapping photos to capture either a scene or subject. Photos must be taken in well-lit lighting conditions with all features visible in multiple photos and no reflective surfaces. Then, software processes the photos to distinguish individual features such as textures and corners. Then, the software analyzes the 2D movement of all these features across all the images with the algorithm inferring the camera’s movement and the 3D position of the features. This perception is similar to how humans perceive depth such as how objects closer to the observer moves faster than objects further away move. Finally, the 3D points are reconstructed to build a 3D model that is typically in the form of point clouds [11].</p>

<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>

<p>There are two methods of SfM: incremental and global. Incremental SfM starts with a pair of images and creates a 3D model by adding cameras and points step by step to estimate a similar pose of the existing construction. Then, it seeds the pair selection to form an initial reconstruction also known as triangulation. This creates a robust and more accurate model. On the other hand, global SfM considers all images and their relationship with each other to be a single optimization problem and attempts to reconstruct the camera poses and points simultaneously. First there is a feature mapping process for all the images that then builds a view graph. Finally, through various rotation and translation averaging, we get a global optimization and a 3D model. Global SfM is more scalable and efficient for large scale mapping but is not as accurate than incremental nor is it as robust if there are outliers or missing data such as if the graph is not fully connected.</p>

<p style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team10/figure_5.png" alt="Figure 5" /></p>
<p>Figure 5. Incremental SfM vs. Global SfM [3]</p>

<h2 id="glomap">GLOMAP</h2>

<h3 id="glomap-overview">GLOMAP Overview</h3>

<p>GLOMAP is a recent global SfM system by Pan et al. that addresses challenges encountered in global SfM.  At a high level, GLOMAP is a general-purpose pipeline designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of global SfMs while retaining its scalable and efficient characteristics of global SfM.  In fact, Pan et. al report that GLOMAP produces on par with or even superior to COLMAP (the incremental gold standard) in accuracy, yet is orders of magnitude faster.  For example, on a large-scale dataset LIN from LaMAR of 36,000 images, GLOMAP obtained ~90% correct camera pose recall at 1m error and reconstructed the scene in approximately 5.5 hours, while COLMAP had only ~50% recall and took more than 7 days to process the same data.  These results highlight a significant step forward for global SfM methods.</p>

<h3 id="challenges-of-global-sfm">Challenges of Global SfM</h3>

<p>The key difficulty in global SfM lies in how it handles noise and outliers when combining all pairwise relations simultaneously. In particular, the global translation averaging step is the main cause of global SfM’s shortfall in robustness.  After estimating relative motions between image pairs (the view graph), global SfM does rotational averaging, which estimates all camera orientations from pairwise relative rotation.  To obtain consistent global camera positions from noisy pairwise translations, however, is the more challenging problem.</p>

<p>When estimating motion between two images, only the direction of the translation can be recovered and not the distance.  This means that every pair of cameras have an unknown scaling factor.  This introduces scale ambiguity that requires multiple loops or triplets of views to resolve.  Furthermore, if those triplets form “skewed” geometric configurations, the scale estimates become very noise-sensitive.  [9]</p>

<p>Another challenge is the global SfM’s heavy dependence on camera intrinsics.  This information is needed so that global SfM can decompose two-view geometry into a direction and scale, and if there is any calibration error, the translation direction becomes highly inaccurate. [7]</p>

<p>In scenarios with nearly collinear motion (e.g. walking forward with a front-facing phone, driving down a street, etc.) the geometry does not provide enough information for translation averaging, and this can cause reconstructions to become unreliable. [9]</p>

<h3 id="glomap-contributions">GLOMAP Contributions</h3>

<p>The key innovation introduced by GLOMAP is jointly estimating all camera positions and 3D points, which replaces the translation averaging step.  In other words, instead of first computing camera translations in isolation and then triangulating points, GLOMAP merges these into one optimization problem in a step the authors call global positioning.  This approach is fundamentally different from prior global SfM systems, which typically did a rotation averaging step, followed by translation averaging, and then triangulation. GLOMAP’s joint global position step replaces the fragile process with one unified optimization that solves for camera positions and 3D points at the same time.</p>

<p>This optimization is achieved by minimizing a robust objective function over all camera centers c<sub>i</sub>, 3D points X<sub>k</sub>, and depth scaling factors d<sub>ik</sub>. Specifically, the method minimizes the misalignment between the observed viewing direction v<sub>ik</sub>, derived from feature tracks and known intrinsics, and the predicted ray from the estimated camera position to the 3D point:</p>

<p style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team10/equation1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here, ρ(⋅) is a robust loss function, and the constraint d<sub>ik</sub> ≥ 0 makes sure that the points lie in front of the corresponding cameras, a basic requirement for valid geometry. This formulation removes the need for a separate translation averaging step by treating the scene structure and camera positions as a part of one problem and solving for both the 3D points and camera positions together. As a result, this approach avoids relying on noisy or ambiguous pairwise translations. It uses feature tracks across multiple views to enforce geometric consistency, and this makes it more reliable under real-world conditions like straight-line motion or inaccurate intrinsics.</p>

<p>Interestingly, GLOMAP doesn’t require any special initialization for either the 3D points or the camera centers. All positions are initialized randomly within a broad volume, and the optimizer is still able to converge to an accurate solution. In practice, the optimizer is able to reliably converge from random initial values, possibly due to the stability of the bounded angular loss used. This is a major contrast with incremental SfM systems, which usually rely on careful seeding with a strong image pair to get started.
To evaluate the effectiveness of GLOMAP, the authors conduct extensive experiments across several benchmark datasets, including ETH3D, LaMAR, IMC 2023, and MIP360. In particular, Figure 6 shows results from the ETH3D MVS (rig) benchmark, comparing GLOMAP against three state-of-the-art SfM systems: OpenMVG, Theia, and COLMAP. GLOMAP achieves the highest average accuracy across all angular thresholds (1°, 3°, and 5°).  For example, it obtains an average AUC @ 5° of 87.2, compared to 81.4 for Theia and just 69.1 for COLMAP. Despite its accuracy, GLOMAP remains computationally efficient. It completes reconstructions in an average of 793.8 seconds across the scenes, which is over 3 times faster than COLMAP (2857.0 seconds on average). These results demonstrate GLOMAP’s ability to produce both higher-quality reconstructions and faster runtimes than prior global and incremental methods, and they showcase GLOMAP as a scalable and robust general-purpose SfM system.</p>

<p style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team10/figure_6.png" alt="Figure 6" /></p>
<p>Figure 6. Performance of GLOMAP on ETH3D MVS Benchmark [7]</p>

<p>GLOMAP is a significant step forward in balancing accuracy, speed, and robustness in Structure-from-Motion. While traditional systems tend to be strong in one or two of these areas, GLOMAP achieves strong performance across all three.  It avoids reliance on carefully selected initialization pairs, handles large-scale reconstructions efficiently, and remains robust under noisy conditions. These characteristics make GLOMAP a practical and adaptable solution for modern SfM tasks.</p>

<h2 id="visual-geometry-grounded-deep-sfm">Visual Geometry Grounded Deep SfM</h2>

<h3 id="vggsfm-overview">VGGSfM Overview</h3>

<p>VGGSfM is a deep learning-based SfM pipeline designed to be fully differentiable end-to-end. It is conceptually closer to a global SfM approach since it estimates all camera poses jointly, but it avoids the typical weaknesses of classical global SfM such as noise-sensitive averaging of rotations and translations. Instead of relying on separate rotation/translation averaging steps, VGGSfM uses learned neural modules (e.g. Transformers) to recover camera parameters collectively, which helps avoid the instability that traditional global methods can face due to noisy pairwise estimates.</p>

<h3 id="challenges-with-current-incremental-sfm-systems">Challenges with Current Incremental SfM Systems</h3>

<p>Traditional incremental SfM systems, like COLMAP, build up 3D reconstructions one step at a time starting with a good image pair and then gradually adding new views. While this works well in many cases, it also introduces a number of weaknesses. One main issue is that these systems rely heavily on chaining pairwise keypoint matches into longer feature tracks. Small errors in matching can add up over time, and this leads to a “drift” in the reconstruction, especially on long sequences. The pipeline also consisted of many disconnected steps, like matching, RANSAC filtering, PnP pose estimation, triangulation, and bundle adjustment, which makes it difficult to train or tune the entire system as a whole.</p>

<p>Since most of these steps are not differentiable, there is no way to optimize them end-to-end.  Another challenge is that these systems require a strong initialization in order to work properly.  Oftentimes, a carefully chosen pair of images with lots of shared features is needed for initialization.  If the initial pair is weak or mismatched, the whole reconstruction can fail or break down.  Finally, traditional pipelines struggle in scenes with low texture or repetitive patterns, where keypoint detection and matching may become unreliable.  In such cases, the system may not be able to find enough consistent matches between images, which prevents it from building the 3D structure.</p>

<h3 id="vggsfm-contributions">VGGSfM Contributions</h3>

<p>A major innovation in VGGSfM is its approach to correspondence tracking. Traditional SfM pipelines typically rely on chaining two-view matches across image pairs to form multi-view feature tracks.  However, this process is prone to error accumulation and drift. VGGSfM replaces this process with a learned 2D point tracking module that operates across the entire image set. Instead of depending on manually designed feature descriptors like SIFT or SuperPoint, it is able to use deep feature extractors and a transformer-based matching module to track points at the pixel level. This results in dense, accurate, and consistent multi-view correspondences, without needing explicit pairwise chaining. Because the point tracking is learned and is end-to-end differentiable, it can adapt during training to improve consistency and coverage, especially in hard conditions like wide baselines or low-texture scenes. The tracker is also able to predict per-point confidence and visibility.  This helps the system to focus only on matches that are high quality during reconstruction stages later in the process.</p>

<p>Another major contribution of VGGSfM is how it handles camera pose estimation.  Instead of registering cameras one at a time like in incremental SfM or solving for relative orientations and positions in traditional global SfM, VGGSfM uses a transformer model that processes all images and track features and predicts all camera poses simultaneously.  This allows the system to reason globally about spatial relationships while avoiding the instability and scale ambiguity that comes with pairwise translation estimation. After pose prediction, VGGSfM initializes 3D points and refines the structure and motion using a differentiable bundle adjustment module.  Unlike traditional bundle adjustment, which depends on external solvers like Ceres, VGGSfM includes a version that’s differentiable and built directly into the neural network, the second-order Theseus solver. Because of this, the model can learn to improve earlier steps, like point tracking or camera pose estimation, so that the final optimization is more accurate. By combining steps such as tracking, pose recovery, triangulation, and refinement into one system that can be trained together, VGGSfM builds a more consistent and reliable SfM pipeline compared to traditional approaches.</p>

<p>In practice, VGGSfM achieves strong results on the 3D computer vision CO3D dataset.  As shown in Table 1, it outperforms other existing SfM methods.  VGGSfM reaches an RRE @ 15° of 92.1 and an RTE @ 15° of 88.3, which is significantly ahead of COLMAP (31.6 and 27.3) and PoseDiffusion (80.5 and 79.8). These results are especially notable given the wide baselines in CO3D, which often cause traditional pipelines to fail. Even without joint training, VGGSfM performs well, but training all components together provides the best accuracy overall.</p>

<p style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team10/figure_7.png" alt="Figure 7" /></p>

<h2 id="instantsfm">InstantSfM</h2>

<h3 id="instantsfm-overview">InstantSfM Overview</h3>

<p>With different SfMs comes with different CPU computational costs that InstantSfM aims to decrease. InstantSfM is a comprehensive system that utilizes a fully sparse and parallel SfM pipeline to improve GPU acceleration in order to achieve significant speedup benefits while preserving performance. This is done through adding additional PyTorch operations that provide native and easy-to-use support directly for users.</p>

<h3 id="challenges-with-current-colmap-and-glomap-3d-reconstruction-software">Challenges with Current COLMAP and GLOMAP 3D Reconstruction Software</h3>

<p>COLMAP and GLOMAP require bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning (GP) which all increase the computational overhead especially when attempting to scale to handle large data scenarios. This leads to a performance tradeoff in order to gain speed in SfM. Additionally, COLMAP and GLOMAP are implemented in C++ which restrains it from benefitting from different external optimization methods. VGGSfM using feed-forward methods for 3D reconstruction, they are still unable to be scalable. For instance, VGGSfM struggles with thousands of input views inputted simultaneously due to a spike in GPU memory usage.</p>

<p>To address this issue, InstantSfM explores the potential in GPU parallel computation in order to gain significant speedups for each critical stage of the entire SfM pipeline. InstantSfM’s design builds on top of the sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization which helps improve BA and GP processing. In fact, through the team’s extensive research, they were able to gain 40x speedup for COLMAP performance without sacrificing accuracy and they even saw improvements in the reconstruction accuracy.</p>

<h3 id="instantsfm-contributions">InstantSfM Contributions</h3>

<p>To achieve such GPU acceleration, Zhong et al. developed a comprehensive SfM optimization pipeline in PyTorch that builds a customized Lie group and Lie algebra. They implemented quaternion addition which extends complex numbers typically seen in the form shown below.</p>

<p style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team10/equation2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Furthermore, they implemented large matrix multiplication operations which were not previously supported by PyTorch. Through their work, InstantSfM provides user-friendly endpoints that allow users to seamlessly integrate it into their work without worrying about the underlying details as they are abstracted away. As a result, InstantSfM is able to tackle the computation bottleneck to provide state-of-the-art accuracy with significant efficiency, allowing SfM technology to be scalable for datasets containing thousands of images.</p>

<p>Additionally, the team extended sparse-aware bundle adjustment to GP in PyTorch to provide the latest global SfM system. This allows readjusting and refining the 3D coordinates during reconstruction and improving the estimates of the 3D geometry and camera poses. This is done through minimizing the reprojection error which measures the difference between the observed 2D image coordinates and the projected 2D coordinates estimated from the 3D points and camera parameters. The team utilized the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm to optimize GP and BA. This algorithm is as follows:</p>

<p style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team10/figure_8.png" alt="Figure 8" /></p>
<p>Figure 8. The Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm [12]</p>

<p>This algorithm uses the Jacobian where each row of the matrix contains the gradient of the 2D reprojection with respect to all the parameters. Hence, this matrix is large by nature which restricts it from being utilized by the GPU. InstantSfM was able to extend the sparse data structure to create a unified framework. They extended the standard 2×7 and 2×3 Jacobian blocks to also provide depth constraint terms by implementing special block assembly routines that handle the geometric constraints while ensuring matrix efficiency. Extending spare-aware bundle adjustment allows scalability to run full bundle adjustment operations on large datasets that contain thousands to millions of images within an appropriate timeframe that allows SfM systems to truly scale.</p>

<p>Diving deeper into InstantSfM benefits compared to COLMAP, GLOMAP, and VGGSfM, the team used Nvidia’ H200 GPU to test against camera pose estimation, quality of rendering with 3D Gaussian splitting to develop photorealistic 3D scenes from 2D input like images or video, and accuracy of 3D map reconstruction. Below are graph depicting the speedup seen with InstantSfM.</p>

<p style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team10/figure_9.png" alt="Figure 9" /></p>

<p>Figure 10. Comparison of GLOMAP vs. InstantSfM on Bundle Adjustment and Global Positioning [12]</p>

<p>From these comparisons, it is evident with the amount of time InstantSfM is able to save. The team tested from input ranging from 100 to 5,000 images taken from the MipNeRF360 dataset. Additionally, there are significant GPU savings</p>

<p style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team10/figure_11.png" alt="Figure 11" /></p>
<p>Figure 11. GPU runtime comparison [12]</p>

<p>By leveraging sparsity awareness operations in PyTorch directly, InstantSfM is able to provide a fast and simple user interface. As seen from the GPU runtime comparison table, InstantSfM is able to accomplish significant speedups compared to current existing SfM approaches in improving robustness in these systems and reconstruction quality.</p>

<h2 id="emerging-alternatives-beyond-sfm">Emerging Alternatives Beyond SfM</h2>

<p>With the rapidly developing field of 3D reconstruction, there have also been emerging alternatives beyond SfMs. Some notable examples include Dense Matching-based Pose estimation, DUSt3R, and MASt3R.</p>

<p>Dense Matching–Based Pose Estimation helps tackle human pose estimation problems with learning the dense correlation between RGB images and different human body surfaces. Such technologies are applicable to human action recognition, human body reconstruction, and human pose transfer. Previously, human pose estimation methods were expanded from Mask R-CNN frameworks that handle top-down operation by first conducting object detection to identify the bounding boxes for each person. Then, matching of the dense correspondence is done with each bounding box. These approaches were not robust as they heavily relied on the Mask R-CNN detection with runtime growing worse as the number of humans in the input image increased. With Direct Dense Pose (DDP), it allows significant speedups. It first predicts the instance mask and the global IUV representation and then aggregates them together [10]. Additionally, DDP incorporates a 2D temporal-smoothing scheme to minimize the temporal jitters when processing video input [6].</p>

<p>DUSt3R is a novel system that provides a way for Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction of arbitrary image collections to improve geometric 3D vision and make them easier to operate. Previously, multi-view stereo reconstruction (MVS) generated 3D models from many 2D images by identifying corresponding coordinates across many different points of views using depth triangulation and photogrammetry principles. However, the caveat to this was a tedious and cumbersome process. Thus, DUSt3R approaches geometric 3D vision in a different way by operating without prior information about the camera’s positioning and calibration process. DUSt3R is based on Transformer encoders and decoders to express pairwise pointmaps in a unified common reference frame. This differs from traditional SfMs that rely on geometric-based approaches to computer vision tasks.</p>

<p>Lastly, MASt3R tackles problems with image matching, which is a key component to 3D vision performance and algorithms. Although traditionally image matching is considered a 3D problem, it can still be solved through a 2D approach through the utilization of DUSt3R. MASt3R extends pointmap regression to improve the robustness in matching views and coordinates with extreme viewpoint changes. Although there is limited accuracy to what MASt3R can provide, it demonstrates potential in improving image matching to handle a diverse set of viewpoints to handle practical real-life applications. Furthermore, MASt3R solves the quadratic complexity with dense matching that serves as a huge speedup liability if not solved. Through MASt3R, a fast matching scheme is available that outperforms current existing approaches by about 30% [5]. MASt3R also differs from SfM systems by having dense matching and outputting dense 3D point clouds which contrasts against SfMs sparse explicit feature matching approaches and sparse 3D point clouds.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Camera pose estimation plays an important role in creating 3D reconstructions from video and image data, with applications ranging from augmented reality to robotics.  Recent developments have introduced new approaches that go beyond the limitations of traditional incremental SfM pipelines.  GLOMAP represents a key advance in global SfM by jointly estimating camera positions and 3D options in a single optimization step to address challenges such as scale ambiguity and collinear motion.  VGGSfM demonstrates how end-to-end differentiable pipelines can improve the SfM pipeline by making it trainable end-to-end.  It uses learned point tracking and jointly estimates all camera poses which helps to reduce drift and improves the performance in challenge scenes (e.g. limited texture information).  The approach introduced by VGGSfM shows how combining learning and geometry can lead to improved SfM pipelines. In addition to the developments made by GLOMAP and VGGSfM, InstantSfM offers significant GPU speedups while preserving reconstruction accuracy and also at times improving it. Together, these approaches reflect the growing diversity of SfM methods and the progress made towards making camera pose estimation more accurate and scalable.</p>

<p>Besides SfMs, there are also many approaches that tackle camera pose estimation and derive 3D structures that are fundamentally different from SfMs. Direct Dense Pose, DUSt3R, and MASt3R are all different approaches that differ from the geometry approach SfMs approach computer vision and 3D reconstruction. These various approaches nurture a diverse range of solutions for various problems in computer vision that allow society’s technologies to advance and be robust to handle different use cases.</p>

<p>These various advancements from various types of SfMs to DUSt3R have many applications to the real world such as being critical pieces of technology for self-driving cars, industrial robotics, and mixed reality. Furthermore, with more efficient and highly accurate technology, safety and wellbeing improves. For instance, drones can be equipped with cameras that can rapidly reproduce disaster sites with 3D reconstruction to help rescue teams accurately map out regions for safe entry and identifying structural risks. Furthermore, with 3D reconstruction, humanity as a whole can preserve cultural and heritage sites in the digital space by developing digital twins of historical sites and artifacts, making cultural exploration more accessible to millions of more people. Lastly, 3D reconstruction empowers medical imaging and helps plan out complex procedures with ease by developing 3D models of the human body. The field of 3D reconstruction and camera pose estimation is a promising field with very much practical applications to society to have immense potential in improving all facets of human life.</p>

<h1 id="abstract"><strong>Abstract</strong></h1>

<p>Efficient and accurate 3D perception from LiDAR point clouds is essential for autonomous driving, yet many methods struggle to balance computational efficiency with robustness to object rotation and scale variation. In this project, we implement and analyze two representative 3D detection frameworks: the anchor-based PointPillars and the anchor-free CenterPoint. Building on these approaches, we propose <strong>CenterPillar</strong>, a hybrid design that combines pillar-based feature encoding with center-based object detection. We evaluate our method on the SemanticKITTI dataset using standard detection and orientation metrics. Our results show that pillar-based bird’s-eye-view representations enable strong localization performance with low computational cost, while center-based detection alleviates several limitations of anchor-based methods.</p>

<h1 id="1-introduction"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h1>
<h2 id="11-motivation"><strong>1.1 Motivation</strong></h2>

<p>Accurate 3D perception is a fundamental requirement for the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles, particularly in complex urban environments where traffic moves in unpredictable patterns. While LiDAR sensors provide rich spatial information, efficiently processing sparse 3D point clouds to detect and track objects in real-time remains a significant computational challenge. Traditional anchor-based methods often struggle to balance inference speed with the ability to accurately regress bounding boxes for objects with diverse orientations and aspect ratios. This project is motivated by the need to evaluate whether shifting from these rigid, predefined anchor boxes to a flexible, center-based object representation can improve detection accuracy and robustness without sacrificing the low-latency performance required for real-world driving systems.</p>

<h2 id="12-problem-setting"><strong>1.2 Problem Setting</strong></h2>

<p>The core problem addresses the limitations of applying standard 2D convolutional pipelines to 3D LiDAR data, which is inherently sparse, unordered, and irregular. Specifically, this project investigates the trade-offs between two distinct detection paradigms on the SemanticKITTI dataset: the anchor-based PointPillars architecture and the anchor-free CenterPoint architecture. The challenge lies in accurately detecting and localizing objects, such as cars, pedestrians, and cyclists, that may be rotated or occluded, a task where traditional axis-aligned anchor boxes often fail or require extensive hyperparameter tuning. By implementing and comparing these architectures, we aim to determine if a point-based representation offers a superior mechanism for handling the geometric complexities of 3D scenes compared to the established anchor-based baseline.</p>

<h2 id="13-datasets"><strong>1.3 Datasets</strong></h2>

<p>In this project, we use SemanticKITTI, a large-scale dataset for semantic scene understanding in autonomous driving, built on top of the KITTI odometry benchmark (Behley et al., 2019) [1]. It provides dense, point-level semantic annotations for LiDAR point clouds collected in urban driving environments, covering a wide range of classes such as road, buildings, vegetation, vehicles, and pedestrians. The dataset consists of sequential scans captured by a Velodyne HDL-64E LiDAR sensor, enabling both semantic segmentation and temporal modeling of 3D scenes, and has become a standard benchmark for LiDAR-based semantic perception.</p>

<h2 id="14-terminology-in-use"><strong>1.4 Terminology In Use</strong></h2>
<h3 id="141-point-cloud"><strong>1.4.1 Point Cloud</strong></h3>

<p>A point cloud is a collection of discrete points in 3D space, typically generated by LiDAR sensors that measure distances by emitting laser pulses and recording their return times (Qi et al., 2017) [5]. Formally, a point cloud can be represented as <br />
\(P = \{(x_i, y_i, z_i, r_i)\}_{i=1}^{N}\)
where \(x_i\), \(y_i\), and \(z_i\) denote the 3D spatial coordinates of each point, and \(r_i\) represents an optional reflectance or intensity value.</p>

<p>Unlike images, point clouds are unordered, sparse, and irregularly distributed, with point density decreasing as distance from the sensor increases. These characteristics make point clouds incompatible with standard convolutional neural networks, which assume dense, grid-structured inputs, and therefore require specialized representations or preprocessing for learning-based methods (Qi et al., 2017 ) [5].<br />

<em>A sample LiDAR point cloud from KITTI dataset</em></p>

<h3 id="142-voxelization"><strong>1.4.2 Voxelization</strong></h3>

<p>Voxelization is the process of converting a 3D point cloud into a regular volumetric grid by partitioning space into small cubic cells, called voxels, and aggregating points within each cell (Zhou &amp; Tuzel, 2018) [6]. While voxelization enables the use of 3D convolutional neural networks, it introduces significant computational and memory overhead due to the sparsity of point clouds and the high cost of 3D convolutions.</p>

<p>In our use of PointPillars, we avoid voxelization along the vertical dimension and instead organize points into vertical pillars on the ground plane, allowing the model to operate entirely with efficient 2D convolutions while preserving 3D geometric information through learned point-level features (Lang et al., 2019) [2].</p>

<h1 id="2-modelsdesigns"><strong>2. Models/Designs</strong></h1>

<h2 id="21-pointpillars"><strong>2.1 PointPillars</strong></h2>

<p>PointPillars is an end-to-end architecture that proposes a fast and accurate way for 3D object detection from LiDAR point clouds, by introducing a learned point cloud encoder that avoids expensive 3D convolutions (Lang et al., 2019) [2]. The key idea is to organize the point cloud into vertical columns (“pillars”) in the ground plane, learning features within each pillar using a lightweight PointNet, and then processing the resulting representation with 2D convolutional networks.</p>

<h3 id="211-from-point-cloud-to-pillars"><strong>2.1.1 From Point Cloud to Pillars</strong></h3>

<p>Instead of discretizing space into 3D voxels, PointPillars only discretizes the ground plane:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The x-y plane is divided into a regular grid.</li>
  <li>Each grid cell defines a pillar, which spans the full height range.</li>
  <li>All points whose (x,y) fall into the same cell are assigned to that pillar.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no binning in the z-dimension, removing a major source of computational cost and hyperparameter tuning.</p>

<p>Because LiDAR point clouds are sparse, most pillars are empty. The method keeps at most P non-empty pillars per frame, and at most N points per pillar (via random sampling or zero-padding). This yields the point cloud as a dense tensor of shape</p>

\[(D, P, N)\]

\[D = \text{number of features per point}\]

\[P = \text{number of non-empty pillars}\]

\[N = \text{maximum number of points per pillar}\]

<h3 id="212-point-decoration-and-central-references"><strong>2.1.2 Point Decoration and Central References</strong></h3>

<p>Each point in a pillar is augmented with relative geometric features:<br />
\((x, y, z, r, x - \bar{x}, y - \bar{y}, z - \bar{z}, x - x_p, y - y_p)\)</p>

\[(\bar{x}, \bar{y}, \bar{z}) = \text{mean of points in the pillar}\]

\[(x_p, y_p) = \text{pillar center}\]

<p>These relative offsets improve translation invariance at the pillar level. They encode the local geometry explicitly and significantly improve detection performance. The final per-point feature dimension is therefore \(D = 9\).</p>

<h3 id="213-pillar-feature-network-learned-encoder"><strong>2.1.3 Pillar Feature Network (Learned Encoder)</strong></h3>

<p>Each pillar is encoded independently using a simplified PointNet-style network:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Apply a shared linear layer (implemented as a 1×1 convolution)</li>
  <li>BatchNorm + ReLU</li>
  <li>Max-pooling across the point dimension</li>
</ol>

<p>This produces one feature vector per pillar, which is formatted as:
\((C, P)\)</p>

\[C = \text{learned feature dimension}\]

<h3 id="214-pseudo-image-construction-bev"><strong>2.1.4 Pseudo-Image Construction (BEV)</strong></h3>

<p>To enable efficient convolutional processing, PointPillars converts the unordered set of learned pillar features into a structured bird’s-eye-view (BEV) representation. After the Pillar Feature Network produces one feature vector \(f_i \in \mathbb{R}^{C}\) for each non-empty pillar i, these features are scattered back onto a fixed \(H \times W\) grid defined on the ground plane, forming a pseudo-image \(F \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times H \times W}\) where \(F[:, yi, xi] = f_i\) and empty cells are zero.</p>

<p>This operation restores spatial structure while avoiding expensive 3D voxel grids: instead of performing convolutions over \((x,y,z)\), the model operates entirely in \((x,y)\) using fast 2D CNNs, with vertical geometry implicitly encoded in the feature channels through learned point-level statistics (e.g., height distributions and relative offsets). As a result, PointPillars preserves essential 3D information while achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains by reducing the problem to 2D convolution on a BEV feature map.<br />

<em>Fig 3. Pillar Feature Extractor [3]</em></p>

<h3 id="215-2d-backbone-network"><strong>2.1.5 2D Backbone Network</strong></h3>

<p>PointPillars uses a multi-scale 2D convolutional backbone, similar in spirit to feature pyramid networks, containing several convolutional blocks with increasing stride, upsampling via transposed convolutions, and feature concatenation across scales. All operations are 2D, which is the key reason the model achieves real-time performance compared to voxel-based 3D CNNs.</p>

<h3 id="216-detection-head"><strong>2.1.6 Detection Head</strong></h3>

<p>Once the BEV feature map is constructed, PointPillars uses a Single Shot Detector head to predict 3D objects in a single forward pass. A dense set of predefined <strong>anchors</strong> is placed on the ground plane, and for each anchor the network outputs a classification score and regression offsets that refine it into a full 3D bounding box \((x, y, z, w, l, h)\).

<h2 id="22-centerpoint"><strong>2.2 CenterPoint</strong></h2>

<p>CenterPoint proposes a shift from bounding box anchors to a point-based representation, addressing the difficulty anchor-based methods have with fitting axis-aligned boxes to rotated objects. By representing, detecting, and tracking objects as points, the framework simplifies the detection pipeline, removes the need for heuristic anchor design and scale tuning, and improves robustness against rotation and aspect ratio variations.</p>

<h3 id="221-objects-as-points"><strong>2.2.1 Objects as Points</strong></h3>

<p>Unlike PointPillars, which relies on predefined anchors, CenterPoint identifies objects by locating their center point in a bird’s-eye-view heatmap. This approach eliminates the need for complex anchor tuning and allows the backbone to learn rotational invariance. The model uses a standard 3D backbone (like VoxelNet or PointPillars) to generate map-view features, which are then flattened and processed to find local heatmap peaks corresponding to object centers.</p>

<h3 id="222-center-based-detection-head"><strong>2.2.2 Center-Based Detection Head</strong></h3>

<p>Once a center is detected, the model regresses other object properties directly from the feature vector at that center location. Several dense regression heads predict attributes such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>3D Size &amp; Orientation:</strong> The width, length, height, and yaw angle (encoded as sine and cosine).</li>
  <li><strong>Sub-voxel Refinement:</strong> An offset to correct quantization errors caused by the backbone’s stride.</li>
  <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> A 2D velocity vector predicting the object’s motion between frames, enabling simple greedy tracking without Kalman filters.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="223-two-stage-refinement"><strong>2.2.3 Two-Stage Refinement</strong></h3>

<p>While the center-based head is efficient, relying solely on the center feature may miss geometric details at the object’s edges. CenterPoint employs a lightweight second stage that extracts point-features from the 3D centers of the predicted bounding box faces (top, bottom, left, right, front, back).

<em>Fig 3. Overview of CenterPoint Framework [4]</em></p>

<h3 id="23-loss-function-and-training-objective"><strong>2.3 Loss Function and Training Objective</strong></h3>

<p>CenterPoint adopts a fully anchor-free supervision strategy, where objects are represented as points in a bird’s-eye-view (BEV) heatmap and all other object attributes are regressed directly from the predicted center locations. This formulation leads to a multi-task training objective that jointly optimizes center localization, bounding box regression, and object orientation.</p>

<p>The overall loss is defined as:</p>

\[L
=
\frac{1}{N_{\text{pos}}}
\left(
\lambda_{hm}L_{hm}
+
\lambda_{reg}L_{reg}
+
\lambda_{dir}L_{dir}
\right)\]

<p>where \(N_{\text{pos}}\) is the number of positive object centers, and \(\lambda_{hm}\), \(\lambda_{reg}\), and \(\lambda_{dir}\) are scalar weights.</p>

<h3 id="231-center-heatmap-loss"><strong>2.3.1 Center Heatmap Loss</strong></h3>

<p>To localize object centers, CenterPoint predicts a dense BEV heatmap in which each object center is represented as a two-dimensional Gaussian peak. Supervising only the exact center pixel results in a highly sparse learning signal, as most locations are labeled as background. To alleviate this issue, CenterPoint follows the CenterNet formulation by rendering a Gaussian around each ground-truth center, with the radius determined by the object’s spatial extent.</p>

<p>The heatmap is trained using focal loss, which addresses the severe imbalance between foreground center locations and background pixels. The focal loss is defined as:</p>

\[L_{hm}
=
-\frac{1}{N}
\sum_{i}
\begin{cases}
(1 - \hat{Y}_i)^{\alpha} \log(\hat{Y}_i), &amp; \text{if } Y_i = 1 \\
(1 - Y_i)^{\beta} \hat{Y}_i^{\alpha} \log(1 - \hat{Y}_i), &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\]

<p>where \(Y_i\) is the ground-truth heatmap value at location \(i\), \(\hat{Y}_i\) is the predicted heatmap value, and \(\alpha = 2\), \(\beta = 4\) are focusing parameters. This formulation suppresses the influence of easy background examples while emphasizing hard positive center locations, thereby improving recall and training stability.</p>

<h3 id="232-bounding-box-regression-loss"><strong>2.3.2 Bounding Box Regression Loss</strong></h3>

<p>After identifying object centers, CenterPoint directly regresses the remaining 3D bounding box parameters from the feature vector at the center location. Each object is parameterized as:</p>

\[(x, y, z, w, l, h, \theta)\]

<p>To stabilize optimization across objects of different scales, the regression targets are optimized using the Smooth L1 loss. The total regression loss is given by:</p>

\[L_{reg}
=
\sum_{b \in \{x, y, z, w, l, h, \theta\}}
\text{SmoothL1}(\Delta b)\]

<p>The Smooth L1 loss is defined as:</p>

\[\text{SmoothL1}(x)
=
\begin{cases}
0.5x^2, &amp; |x| &lt; 1 \\
|x| - 0.5, &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\]

<p>This loss behaves quadratically for small residuals, enabling precise localization, while remaining linear for large errors, improving robustness during early training.</p>

<h3 id="233-orientation-and-direction-loss"><strong>2.3.3 Orientation and Direction Loss</strong></h3>

<p>Direct regression of object orientation is challenging due to the periodic nature of angles, as rotations differing by \(2\pi\) represent the same physical orientation. To address this issue, CenterPoint encodes yaw using both continuous regression and discrete classification.</p>

<p>The yaw residual is expressed using a sine formulation:</p>

\[\Delta \theta
=
\sin(\theta_{gt} - \theta_{pred})\]

<p>In addition, CenterPoint introduces a direction classification loss by discretizing the yaw angle into two bins (e.g., \([0, \pi)\) and \([\pi, 2\pi)\)) and applying a softmax cross-entropy loss:</p>

\[L_{dir}
=
-\sum_{k} y_k \log(\hat{y}_k)\]

<p>where \(y_k\) is the ground-truth direction label and \(\hat{y}_k\) is the predicted probability. This auxiliary loss resolves the 180-degree ambiguity common in symmetric objects and significantly improves orientation estimation accuracy.</p>

<h3 id="234-final-objective"><strong>2.3.4 Final Objective</strong></h3>

<p>By combining dense center heatmap supervision, direct regression of object geometry, and explicit orientation classification, the CenterPoint loss function enables stable and efficient training without requiring anchor assignment. This design integrates naturally with pillar-based BEV representations and is well-suited for real-time 3D object detection in autonomous driving scenarios.</p>

<h1 id="3-our-implementation"><strong>3. Our Implementation</strong></h1>

<p>For our experiments on the SemanticKITTI dataset, we utilized a hybrid “PointPillars with CenterPoint” architecture that combines the efficient feature encoding of PointPillars with the anchor-free detection head of CenterPoint. In this setup, the PointPillars backbone first discretizes the raw LiDAR point cloud into vertical columns to create a dense 2D pseudo-image, effectively bypassing the computational bottleneck of 3D convolutions. This feature map is then processed by the CenterPoint head, which identifies objects as points in a heatmap rather than relying on predefined anchor boxes; the network localizes object centers and regresses dense 3D attributes, including size, orientation, and velocity, directly from the center features. This design allows us to leverage the high inference speed of the pillar-based encoder while mitigating the difficulties anchor-based methods face when fitting bounding boxes to rotated objects in complex driving environments. This hybrid design is not directly provided in existing codebases and represents our own architectural integration of PointPillars and CenterPoint.</p>

<h1 id="4-results"><strong>4. Results</strong></h1>

<p>We evaluated the PointPillars model on the SemanticKITTI benchmark using the standard KITTI evaluation protocol. The performance was measured using Average Precision (AP) across three difficulty levels (Easy, Moderate, Hard) for three primary classes: Car, Pedestrian, and Cyclist. Additionally, we evaluated the Average Orientation Similarity (AOS) to assess the model’s ability to predict object heading.</p>

<h2 id="42-analysis"><strong>4.2 Analysis</strong></h2>

<h3 id="421-2d-detection-vs-3d-detection"><strong>4.2.1 2D Detection vs. 3D Detection</strong></h3>

<p>The model achieves its highest scores in the 2D Detection task (Overall AP: 70.75%), particularly for Cars, where performance reaches 82.75% on Easy samples. This behavior is expected, as 2D detection only requires projecting 3D bounding boxes onto the image plane, which is a more forgiving metric than accurately reconstructing the full 3D volume.</p>

<p>The gap between 2D and 3D performance is most pronounced in the Pedestrian class. While pedestrian detection reaches 54.05% AP (Easy) in 2D, it drops to 43.32% AP (Easy) in full 3D detection. This disparity highlights the difficulty of resolving depth and precise spatial volume for small, non-rigid objects, compared to simply identifying their presence in a 2D view. In contrast, larger and more rigid objects, such as cars, maintain relatively strong performance across both detection modalities.</p>

<h3 id="422-birds-eye-view-bev-performance"><strong>4.2.2 Bird’s Eye View (BEV) Performance</strong></h3>

<p>The BEV Detection results closely track the 2D detection trends and consistently outperform full 3D detection. Specifically, the model achieves an Overall BEV AP of 68.20%, compared to 61.45% for 3D detection. This performance gap reflects the architectural strengths of the PointPillars-based pipeline, which operates by projecting features into a 2D ground-plane grid, or pseudo-image.</p>

<p>Because the network is inherently optimized for estimating horizontal spatial coordinates (x, y), it excels at top-down localization, which is critical for navigation and planning tasks. However, the accurate regression of the vertical dimension (z) required for full 3D detection remains a more challenging learned component. These results reinforce the effectiveness of BEV representations for precise ground-plane localization while maintaining computational efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="423-orientation-estimation-aos"><strong>4.2.3 Orientation Estimation (AOS)</strong></h3>

<p>The <strong>Average Orientation Similarity (AOS)</strong> indicates how well the model understands object heading.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cars:</strong> The model shows exceptional orientation capability for cars (82.56% Easy), nearly matching its detection accuracy. The rigid, rectangular geometry of cars in the point cloud makes heading estimation reliable.</li>
  <li><strong>Cyclists:</strong> Performance for cyclists is strong on easy samples (75.07%), significantly outperforming pedestrians. This is likely because bicycles, like cars, have an elongated shape that provides a clear directional axis. However, there is a substantial drop in performance for moderate samples (down to 60.76%).</li>
  <li><strong>Pedestrians:</strong> There is a sharp drop in AOS for pedestrians (40.76% Easy). Unlike cars, pedestrians are roughly cylindrical and non-rigid, making their orientation ambiguous in sparse LiDAR data. This suggests that while the model can detect where a pedestrian is, it struggles to predict which direction they are facing.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="424-impact-of-difficulty-levels"><strong>4.2.4 Impact of Difficulty Levels</strong></h3>

<p>Across all metrics, there is a clear performance degradation from “Easy” to “Hard,” though the severity of this drop varies significantly by class.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cars (Robustness):</strong> Cars demonstrate the highest resilience to increased difficulty. In 3D detection, the performance drops approximately 10% from Easy (71.23%) to Moderate (61.66%), but then stabilizes, dropping only another ~2.5% for Hard samples. This stability indicates that even when cars are partially occluded or at a distance, their large surface area ensures enough points remain to form a recognizable pillar structure.</li>
  <li><strong>Cyclists (Occlusion Sensitivity):</strong> Cyclists suffer the sharpest decline in performance. There is a massive drop of nearly 17% in 3D AP from Easy (69.81%) to Moderate (53.26%). This suggests that cyclists are particularly susceptible to occlusion. Unlike cars, a bicycle is a thin, skeleton-like object; if partially blocked or seen from a poor angle, it may lose critical geometric features (like the gap between wheels), causing the detector to miss it entirely.</li>
  <li><strong>Pedestrians (Inherent Difficulty):</strong> The trend for pedestrians is distinct. While the drop from Easy to Hard is numerically smaller than for cyclists (decreasing ~11% total in 3D AP), the baseline performance is significantly lower to begin with (starting at only 61.45%). This implies that pedestrians are inherently difficult to detect regardless of the specific difficulty annotation. Because of their small physical cross-section, even “Easy” (non-occluded, close) pedestrians occupy very few pillars. By the time the difficulty reaches “Hard,” the point density likely becomes too sparse for the pillar feature encoder to distinguish a person from a vertical pole or background noise, resulting in a low 43.52% AP.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="5-conclusion"><strong>5. Conclusion</strong></h1>

<p>In summary, we demonstrated that combining a pillar-based encoder with a center-based detection head offers an effective balance between efficiency and robustness. By integrating PointPillars with CenterPoint, we retained real-time performance while reducing sensitivity to anchor design. Future work could explore tighter integration of temporal information or extend the approach to full 3D segmentation tasks. Additionally, the two models were only trained on 80 epochs due to computational restraints. At deeper depths, there might be changes in how the models perform relative to each other. Additionally, testing the model on newer datasets like the Waymo Open Dataset or NuScenes would provide temporal information that could boost model performance.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-medical-image-segmentation">What is Medical Image Segmentation?</h2>
<p>Medical image segmentation is a part of the medical image analysis process for images like CT scans and MRIs. It refers to the process of identifying pixels in medical images that correspond to organs, lesions, or other medical regions. 
The goal is to extract information about the shape and volume of organs, tissues, and other identified regions. Tackling this task with deep learning is a challenge as there is a high level of complexity and diversity with medical images [4]. This report will serve as a literature review of the advances in medical image segmentation over the past few years.</p>

<h2 id="v-net-fully-convolutional-neural-networks-for-volumetric-medical-image-segmentation">V-Net: Fully Convolutional Neural Networks for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation</h2>
<p>At the time that this model was developed, deep learning was growing rapidly in popularity and CNNs were being applied to solve a variety of problems. However, a lot of the models were designed to work with 2D image slices, which results in a significant data loss for medical image segmentation tasks. The goal of V-Net was to be a CNN that was trained and developed to handle 3D image segmentation [3].</p>

<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>V-Net is a fully convolutional neural network. The network is divided into stages that each have one to three convolutional layers. Convolutions are performed using kernels of the size 5x5x5. As stages progress, the path is compressed with 2x2x2 kernels being used (this decreases the feature map size). Downsampling is also used to reduce the size of the signals and increase the receptive field of the features. Instead of max pooling, V-Net uses strided convolutions [3]. This decreases memory usage and improves model interpretability.
The model introduces a novel function, optimized using the Dice coefficient (measures similarity between datasets). This loss function was added to address the imbalance in foreground and background pixels that is commonly found in medical image segmentation tasks. The Dice coefficient measures the overlap between predicted and ground truth segmentations. This allows for the foreground and background to then be balanced.</p>

\[D = \frac{2 \sum (p_i g_i)}{\sum (p_i^2) + \sum (g_i^2)}\]

<h3 id="training-and-results">Training and Results</h3>
<p>V-Net was trained on a dataset of prostate scans in MRI. Since there aren’t many annotated medical images available for training, the model was also trained on deformed versions of the training dataset.</p>

<p style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/13/vnet.png" alt="V-Net Image Results" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 1. Image segmentation results on prostate MRI scans from the PROMISE 2012 dataset</em> [3].</p>

<p>The trained model, V-Net, performs the image segmentation tasks on the dataset with a higher accuracy and less processing time than previous methods. The results can be seen in the table below where V-Net with Dice loss has the highest score.</p>

<h2 id="transunet-transformers-make-strong-encoders-for-medical-image-segmentation">TransUNet: Transformers make Strong Encoders for Medical Image Segmentation</h2>
<p>A few years after the discussed work with CNNs in medical imaging, U-Net become a popular model for medical image segmentation. TransUNet takes a hybrid approach, taking parts of the U-Net and Transformer model architectures [1].</p>

<h3 id="implementation-1">Implementation</h3>
<p>U-Nets and CNNs have proven to be extremely useful for detail retention. A core limitation, however, is the inability to handle long-range relations. The transformer architecture addresses this with attention mechanisms that are designed to store long-range relations for sequence-to-sequence prediction.
ResNet-50 is used first as a CNN encoder for initial feature extraction. Then a Vision Transformer (ViT) layer is used. This order allows high-resolution CNN feature maps to be leveraged and performs better than just using a pure Transformer for the decoder.
After this, a cascade upsampler is used to output the final segmentation mask. Multiple upsampling blocks are cascaded until the full correct resolution is reached [1].</p>

<h3 id="training-and-results-1">Training and Results</h3>
<p>The model was trained on a multi-organ segmentation dataset called the MICCAI 2025 Multi-Altas Abdomen Labeling Challenge.</p>

<p><em>Table 2. TransUNet’s performance on the dataset compared to other methods</em> [1].</p>

<h2 id="segment-anything-in-medical-images">Segment Anything in Medical Images</h2>
<p>Up until this point, many of the models and advances in medical image segmentation were focused on developing models that needed to be tailored towards specific modalities or conditions. However, in practice, it is valuable to have generalizability across different types of medical image segmentation tasks. MedSAM addresses this as a model for universal medical image segmentation [2].</p>

<h3 id="implementation-2">Implementation</h3>
<p>The model is based on the vision transformer architecture. The model was initialized with a pre-trained SAM model and masked autoencoder modeling. Then it was trained with fully supervised training. The loss function is a combination of the Dice loss and cross-entropy loss. The AdamW optimizer was used for parameter optimization.
MedSAM is also unique with a promptable interface. Compared to the previous automatic segmentation processes, MedSAM allows users to identify targets with bounding boxes [2]. This is an important feature for handling multiple types of medical images.</p>

<p style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/13/medsam.png" alt="MedSAM Architecture" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 3. A diagram of the MedSAM architecture, including the prompt encoder</em> [2].</p>

<h3 id="training-and-results-2">Training and Results</h3>
<p>One of the major issues that the other specialist models had was the lack of data availability for training. The researchers working on MedSAM curated their own set of images and 3d datasets from public sources. Images were converted and normalized to ensure uniformity and compatibility.
MedSAM performance is on par with specialist models, even though it works with a much larger range of medical images.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Studio photography aims to produce aesthetically polished images. However, even in controlled environments, unwanted objects such as chairs, props, wires etc often appear in the scene. Traditionally, these objects have been removed manually, requiring careful reconstruction of the background and its lighting conditions. Although precise, manual editing is slow and labor-intensive.</p>

<p>Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) have opened new possibilities for automating this process. Given an image, the object being removed, and potentially other helpful information such as shadow location and the environment, ML models are tasked with outputting a natural looking image without the object and corresponding shadow. In this report, we discuss the different approaches ML models take in achieving this goal and their respective advantages and drawbacks.</p>

<h2 id="background-and-key-concepts">Background and Key Concepts</h2>

<p>The automation of advanced image editing requires a convergence of several computer vision disciplines, moving beyond simple pixel manipulation to semantic scene understanding. As studio workflows demand increasing speed and precision, the ability to algorithmically modify images, specifically removing objects and their environmental effects, has become a focal point of research. This section outlines the fundamental concepts underpinning these technologies, identifying the specific challenges associated with reconstructing visual data and the high-level strategies currently employed to solve them.</p>

<p>Image Inpainting is the process of reconstructing missing or corrupted regions of an image to restore its visual continuity. Early techniques relied on patch-based synthesis, which filled holes by copying and pasting similar textures from the surrounding valid pixels. While effective for simple, repetitive backgrounds, these methods often fail to preserve global structure or semantic coherence in complex scenes. Modern approaches utilize deep generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks and diffusion models, to “hallucinate” plausible content based on learned distributions. The primary challenge in a professional context is not merely filling the void, but generating high frequency details such as film grain or surface texture that match the fidelity of the original high resolution capture.</p>

<p>Shadow Detection and Removal presents a distinct set of challenges, as shadows are not objects themselves but rather the result of complex interactions between scene geometry and illumination. In studio photography, removing an object without addressing its cast shadow results in “ghosting artifacts” that immediately destroy the realism of the edit. Unlike opaque objects, shadows are semi-transparent. They darken the background without obscuring the underlying texture. Successfully removing a shadow requires the model to distinguish between illumination changes and intrinsic surface properties, a process often complicated by soft penumbras, inter-reflections, and colored lighting common in commercial sets.</p>

<p>General Strategies for addressing these tasks broadly fall into two categories: end-to-end learning frameworks and physics-based decomposition methods. Learning-based strategies leverage massive datasets of paired images, both with and without objects, to implicitly learn the correlation between foregrounds and backgrounds, treating the problem as a high-dimensional signal translation task. Conversely, physics-based approaches attempt to explicitly model the scene’s lighting and geometry, often decomposing the image into reflectance and shading layers to surgically modify the illumination. While recent trends favor the generative flexibility of the former, the structural consistency of the latter remains relevant. The specific architectures and performance trade-offs of these competing methodologies are detailed in the subsequent sections.</p>

<h2 id="inpainting-and-object-removal-methods">Inpainting and Object Removal Methods</h2>

<h3 id="resolution-robust-large-mask-inpainting-with-fourier-convolutions"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07161">Resolution-Robust Large Mask Inpainting with Fourier Convolutions</a></h3>

<p>Large-mask inpainting is an inherently difficult problem because traditional convolutional neural networks lack a sufficiently large receptive field to capture global structures. When large regions of an image are missing (such as after removing a studio light stand or a softbox) the model must infer global texture patterns, geometry, and long-range spatial relationships. Classical and GAN-based inpainting models tend to produce blurry or repetitive textures, and they often break structural continuity across big holes.  LaMa targets this limitation by introducing a method that enables global context aggregation early in the network while remaining robust across varying image resolutions, without requiring extremely deep or computationally expensive networks (since it is trained with low resolution images).</p>

<p style="width: 640px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/14/image-0013.png" alt="OmniEraser architecture" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:0.9em;"><em>LaMa architecture</em></p>

<p>LaMa is built around a feed-forward ResNet-like inpainting network that integrates Fast Fourier Convolutions (FFCs) into its residual blocks. FFCs split feature channels into a local branch that uses standard spatial convolutions, and a global branch that applies real-valued FFT, performs spectral-domain convolution, and returns to spatial domain via inverse FFT. This allows the generator to achieve an image-wide receptive field even in early layers, addressing the limitations of conventional convolutional models. The architecture includes downsampling blocks, multiple FFC-based residual blocks, and upsampling blocks. The paper also incorporates adversarial loss, a high receptive field perceptual loss, and a feature-matching loss as part of its training objective. Specifically, LaMa uses a patch-level discriminator, an R1 gradient penalty, and discriminator-based perceptual loss, in addition to the proposed high receptive field perceptual loss. Training uses aggressive large-mask generation strategies, including wide and box masks, to force the model to utilize its large receptive field. All training is fully convolutional, and the network processes four-channel inputs consisting of the masked image and mask.</p>

<p>The paper introduces three major contributions. First, it proposes an inpainting network based on FFCs, which provide an image-wide receptive field and allow the model to use global context from early layers. The authors show that this improves perceptual quality, helps capture periodic structures, and supports generalization to higher resolutions. Second, LaMa introduces a high receptive field perceptual loss, built on a segmentation model with dilated or Fourier convolutions, ensuring that the loss function, just as the network itself, has the large receptive field required for global structure reasoning. This loss was shown in ablation studies to be important for the large-mask setting. Third, the authors develop an aggressive large-mask training strategy using wide and box masks. The paper demonstrates that this strategy improves performance on both wide and narrow masks, unlocking the benefits of the architecture and loss design.</p>

<p style="width: 640px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/14/image-0017.png" alt="Video4Removal pipeline" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:0.9em;"><em>Quantitative results of LaMa vs other methods</em></p>

<p>LaMa achieves state-of-the-art quantitative results across datasets such as Places and CelebA-HQ, outperforming a wide range of strong baselines on both narrow and wide masks. The FFC-based model consistently shows better FID and LPIPS scores than competing methods, including those with significantly larger parameter counts. Qualitative results in the paper demonstrate that LaMa can reconstruct complex periodic structures such as windows, fences, and bricks much more effectively than prior methods. The model also shows strong generalization to high-resolution images, despite being trained only on 256×256 crops. Experiments applying the network fully convolutionally to 512×512 and 1536×1536 images reveal that FFC-based models degrade much less than regular convolutional ones as resolution increases. Ablation studies also confirm the effectiveness of each proposed component: FFCs improve wide-mask inpainting, the high receptive field perceptual loss enhances global structure consistency, and large-mask training boosts performance across mask types.</p>

<p style="width: 640px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/14/image-0020.png" alt="Lighting-aware architecture" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:0.9em;"><em>Qualitative results of LaMa vs other methods</em></p>

<p>LaMa is ideal for removing large objects in studio scenes, such as light stands, cables, reflectors, tripods, or background supports. Its ability to reconstruct smooth backdrops or wide studio walls makes it especially practical for indoor photography. However, because it does not explicitly model lighting or shadows, LaMa does not remove shadow artifacts as effectively as newer methods. For studio workflows, LaMa is best as a baseline inpainting stage that fills structural background regions, followed by lighting-aware refinement if shadows must be preserved or reconstructed.</p>

<h3 id="smart-eraser"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08279">Smart Eraser</a></h3>

<p>The SmartEraser addresses the structural limitations of the prevailing mask-and-inpaint paradigm used by most diffusion based object removal tools. In traditional approaches, the masked region is entirely excluded from the input, forcing the model to hallucinate missing content using only the surrounding unmasked context. This lack of visibility into the removed object often produces two characteristic artifacts: object regeneration (example: generating a new car instead of removing the old one) and background distortion (failing to preserve the continuity of the underlying scene).</p>

<p>The SmartEraser is built on a text-to-image diffusion model but fundamentally modifies the conditioning mechanism through a paradigm called Masked-Region Guidance. Rather than supplying the model with a masked-out image, it retains the original image information in the input, represented as [m, x] instead of [m x ⊙ (1−m)].</p>

<p style="width: 640px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/14/image-0027.png" alt="Lighting-aware architecture" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:0.9em;"><em>Comparison of the "mask-and-inpaint" paradigm versus the proposed Masked-Region Guidance paradigm. Unlike the traditional approach, Masked-Region Guidance retains the masked region in the input to better identify removal targets</em></p>

<p>This allows the model to explicitly perceive the semantic content of the target object. To strengthen this semantic awareness, SmartEraser incorporates CLIP-based visual guidance where the masked region is cropped and fed into a CLIP vision encoder, and a trainable MLP maps these features into the text encoder’s space. This representation is then combined with the prompt “Remove the instance of …” to guide the diffusion process.</p>

<p>To address inaccuracies in user-provided masks, SmartEraser introduces a Mask Enhancement module during training. This module simulates mask perturbations (dilation, erosion, and convex hull transformations) to reduce the gap between highly precise training masks and imperfect real-world user inputs.</p>

<p>Beyond its architectural contributions, the paper’s primary innovation is Syn4Removal, a large-scale synthetic dataset designed to overcome the scarcity of paired training data. Existing datasets typically lack scene diversity or rely on pseudo-ground truths generated by other inpainting models. Syn4Removal instead uses a high quality copy/paste synthesis pipeline where  objects are segmented from source images and alpha-blended onto diverse backgrounds.</p>

<p style="width: 640px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/14/image-0031.png" alt="Lighting-aware architecture" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:0.9em;"><em>The data generation pipeline for Syn4Removal. Object instances are filtered, resized, and alpha-blended onto background images to create training triplets</em></p>

<p>Importantly, objects are pasted only into feasible areas (regions that do not overlap with existing scene elements), ensuring that the ground truth (the empty background) remains an unaltered photograph.</p>

<p>The SmartEraser was evaluated against state-of-the-art baselines including LaMa, PowerPaint, and CLIPAway on the RORD-Val and DEFACTO-Val benchmarks. Quantitatively, it outperformed all baselines, surpassing PowerPaint by 10.3 FID points on the challenging RORD-Val dataset. Qualitative comparisons and user studies further show that SmartEraser effectively avoids regeneration artifacts and preserves background realism.</p>

<p>For studio photo retouching, SmartEraser is specifically well-suited to removing props and distractions. The Masked-Region Guidance approach ensures that the model removes specific items (such as light stands, cables, product supports) without hallucinating new content in their place. Additionally, the Syn4Removal methodology provides a blueprint for generating domain specific training triplets where studios can paste their own products onto blank studio backgrounds to create unlimited fine-tuning data tailored to their lighting setups.</p>

<p>The OmniEraser addresses a persistent challenge in high-end image editing which is  removing an object along with its associated visual effects, specifically shadows and reflections. While standard inpainting models often succeed in removing the object itself, they frequently leave behind cast shadows or floor reflections, resulting in “ghost” artifacts that break realism.</p>

<p style="width: 640px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/14/image-0034.png" alt="Lighting-aware architecture" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:0.9em;"><em>Comparison of OmniEraser against state-of-the-art methods. OmniEraser successfully removes objects along with their shadows and reflections, whereas other methods leave artifacts or generate unintended objects</em></p>

<p>Additionally, many existing methods produce shape-like distortions in the edited region because they rely exclusively on background information without explicit modeling of object geometry.</p>

<p>The OmniEraser builds upon the FLUX.1-dev diffusion model, a DiT-based Transformer architecture, augmented with LoRA for efficient fine-tuning. Its central innovation is Object-Background Guidance, a dual-path conditioning framework. Instead of treating the image as a single unified input, the model processes the foreground object and the background as independent guidance signals during the denoising process. The hidden representations of the masked object, masked background, noise input, and mask are concatenated and passed through a trainable linear layer.</p>

<p style="width: 640px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/14/image-0038.png" alt="Lighting-aware architecture" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:0.9em;"><em>Architecture of OmniEraser featuring Object-Background Guidance. The model uses latent representations from both the object and background as joint input conditions</em></p>

<p>This conditioning forces the model to learn the relationship between the object and its environment which allows for the accurate removal of both the object and its lighting effects.</p>

<p>To support this capability, the authors introduce Video4Removal, a large-scale dataset built from real-world video footage rather than synthetic compositing. Unlike synthetic datasets such as Syn4Removal (which cannot realistically capture shadows or reflections),  Video4Removal uses fixed-camera videos of scenes with and without moving subjects. Foreground and background frames are separated using the Mixture of Gaussians (MOG) algorithm, producing over 100,000 high-quality triplets that naturally include real shadows, lighting variations, and reflections (visual phenomena that are extremely difficult to synthesize).</p>

<p style="width: 640px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/14/image-0041.png" alt="Lighting-aware architecture" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:0.9em;"><em>The construction pipeline of Video4Removal. Foreground and background frames are separated from video footage to create realistic training pairs with natural lighting effects</em></p>

<p>The OmniEraser was benchmarked on RORD-Val and on a newly proposed dataset, RemovalBench, constructed specifically to evaluate shadow and reflection removal. Quantitative results show state-of-the-art performance: for example, OmniEraser achieves an FID of 39.52, outperforming CLIPAway’s 55.49 on RemovalBench. Visual comparisons highlight its ability to seamlessly remove complex shadows and reflections on glossy surfaces which is an area where competing models consistently fail or hallucinate unrealistic textures.</p>

<p>The OmniEraser is especially impactful for lighting-aware studio retouching. Studio photography relies heavily on controlled lighting that produces intentional shadows and reflections, which are notoriously difficult to remove manually. OmniEraser’s ability to eliminate both an object and its cast shadow in a single pass directly addresses a major bottleneck in e-commerce and catalog workflows. Moreover, the Video4Removal pipeline generalizes naturally to studio setups: studios can generate perfect datasets by recording their sets before and during a shoot, capturing the exact lighting behavior required for training</p>

<p>Traditional inpainting only cares about the object itself, not the shadows. As such, the left over shadows look out of place. Methods such as HiFill[1] and DeepFill[2] that take shadows into account still require specifying shadow regions. Shadows also vary a lot in hardness, subtext, so approaches relying on hard boundaries as seen in [3] do not work well.</p>

<p>Differential rendering is a classical technique that attempts to solve this problem by building a rough 3D proxy of the scene, rendering it before and after an edit, and then applying the pixelwise difference between the two renders to the real image. While this should in theory encode how shadows should change, scene proxies are almost always inaccurate. A more robust method is needed to identify and remove only the object’s shadows.</p>

<p style="width: 640px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/14/image-0047.png" alt="Lighting-aware architecture" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:0.9em;"><em>Model architecture. It takes an input image, a mask of the object to remove, and renderings of a rough scene model with and without the object. It first decomposes the input image into texture and lighting. It then removes the object’s shadows from the lighting image.

<p>The architecture consists of multiple neural networks (U-Nets). The shadow segmentation network learns to indicate where shadows exist. The intrinsic decomposition network splits the image into two - texture and lighting. The shadow removal network removes the shadow cast only by the object removed. The inpainting later fills in lighting behind the removed object. An HFill texture inpainting tool is used to inpaint reflectance. Lastly, the final compost layer recombines the texture and lighting to the final output.</p>

<p>Previous methods either ignored shadows or relied on a manually drawn shadow mask. This paper removes shadows automatically. Furthermore, this method works even with an inaccurate proxy because of its intrinsic decomposition. Shadows of other objects remain intact.</p>

<p>DreamPainter is designed to address two challenges in e-commerce background generation. First, existing inpainting methods struggle to maintain product consistency, including proper spatial arrangement, coherent shadows, and realistic reflections between the foreground and the generated background. The paper attributes this to the lack of high-quality, domain-specific e-commerce datasets, noting that models trained on generic data often produce inconsistent lighting, low-resolution backgrounds, or stylistically mismatched imagery. Second, the authors emphasize that relying solely on text prompts is not enough for controlling background generation in professional settings. Text descriptions cannot always express visual attributes such as color gradients, material textures, or stylistic preferences. This issue becomes worse when creators seek to translate abstract design concepts into precise visual outputs.</p>

<p style="width: 640px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/14/image-0059.png" alt="Lighting-aware architecture" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:0.9em;"><em>Architecture of DreamPainter</em></p>

<p>DreamPainter transforms a text-to-image diffusion model into a background inpainting model by incorporating both textual and visual conditioning signals. The system takes as input the foreground image, mask, target image, and optional background reference image, and encodes each using a VAE into corresponding latent representations. These latents, along with text prompt embeddings and a downsampled mask, are fed into a diffusion transformer architecture (DiT) through two conditioning strategies.</p>

<p>The first strategy uses input-layer channel concatenation, where the model concatenates latent tensors along the channel and spatial dimensions and feeds them into the first layer. The second strategy, which the authors adopt, introduces an auxiliary control branch that processes the mask, foreground, and noisy target latents. The output of this branch is injected into each diffusion layer through a learnable gate initialized to zero. This design builds off prior findings that additional control branches can improve training stability and efficiency.</p>

<p>Reference images are incorporated by concatenating reference latents with target and text tokens along the spatial dimension and assigning distinct positional encodings. By giving the reference tokens separate positional indices, the model avoids confusion between the target and reference spatial structures. In the second stage of training, LoRA modules are added to the DiT blocks to adapt the base model to reference-guided generation while keeping earlier components frozen. Together, these mechanisms enable DreamPainter to accept text-only control, text-plus-reference control, and user-adjustable reference influence.</p>

<p style="width: 640px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/14/image-0062.png" alt="Lighting-aware architecture" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:0.9em;"><em>Quantitative results</em></p>

<p>The paper reports extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations of DreamPainter on text-to-image (T2I) and text-and-reference-to-image (TR2I) inpainting tasks. On T2I background inpainting, DreamPainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EcomXL-Inpainting, FLUX-Inpainting, FLUX-Fill, OmniControl, and UNO. The model achieves the highest scores across IR-Score, PickScore, and Object Consistency, with the latter reaching 0.986, indicating minimal distortion of foreground objects. Human evaluators overwhelmingly prefer DreamPainter’s results, with win rates exceeding 90% against all baselines.</p>

<p style="width: 640px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/14/image-0065.png" alt="Lighting-aware architecture" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:0.9em;"><em>Qualitative results / comparions</em></p>

<p>On TR2I inpainting, DreamPainter demonstrates even larger performance gains. It surpasses multi-image editing methods like UNO and BAGEL across all quantitative metrics, achieving a 137% improvement over the second-best method in IR-Score and a 125% improvement in PickScore. Object Consistency and CLIP-based semantic alignment also show substantial gains. Human evaluation again supports these findings, with DreamPainter winning over 92% of comparison pairs. Qualitative examples in the text and figures show that DreamPainter preserves product fidelity while producing coherent, stylized, and contextually appropriate backgrounds.</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:0.9em;"><em>Qualitative results / comparions</em></p>

<p>Although designed for product photography, DreamPainter is highly relevant to studio retouching because it demonstrates the power of multi-modal control in background editing. A studio editor could mask out a light stand, supply a clean reference background from the same shoot, or describe the desired fill via text. DreamPainter’s ability to harmonize lighting across the edited region aligns closely with professional studio needs, where shadows, reflections, and background gradients must remain consistent. Its multi-control architecture also suggests how future studio-retouching tools may combine mask guidance, lighting cues, and reference photos for fully controllable ML-driven editing.</p>

<h3 id="scribblelight"><a href="https://chedgekorea.github.io/ScribbleLight/#:~:text=ScribbleLight%2C%20a%20generative%20model%20that,from%20sparse%20scribble%20annotations">ScribbleLight</a></h3>

<p>ScribbleLight addresses the significant challenge of single-image indoor relighting, a task complicated by the presence of multiple light sources, cluttered objects, and intricate material variations. Previous methods often relied on dense scene capture, which is labor-intensive, or implicit latent representations that offer only coarse, global control over illumination. To bridge the gap between technical complexity and creative flexibility, ScribbleLight introduces a generative framework that allows users to manipulate lighting locally—such as turning lamps on or off, or adjusting sunlight—using intuitive, sparse scribbles. This approach treats user input as binary guidance, where scribbles indicate areas to brighten or darken, leaving the model to infer plausible physical interactions like soft shadows and inter-reflections. The key advances, briefly mentioned here, are related to Intrinsic Image Decomposition, i.e. separating an image into illumination dependent and independent components. ScribbleLight uses components from both groups to achieve a realistic looking outcome; specifically, ScribbleLight uses Albedo, how reflective a surface is, and normals, a representation of the 3d map of the image in combination with the image itself to generate a realistic looking output.</p>

<p style="width: 640px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/14/image-0077.png" alt="Lighting-aware architecture" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:0.9em;"><em>ScribbleLight works in a multi-stage process with stage 1 containing an Albedo-conditioned Stable image Diffusion model and stage 2 containing a ControlNet that guides the albedo model.
</em></p>

<p>The core of the model is a modified Stable Diffusion v2 framework, divided into two training stages. The first stage contains an Albedo-conditioned Stable image Diffusion model. To preserve the intrinsic color and texture of the original scene, the model uses pre-trained Latent VAE Encoders to encode the image and albedo into the latent space. Then, noise for a random time sample from Stable Diffusion is added back into the latent space code. Image noise is randomly added while albedo noise is added from time step T = 200. Then, the albedo-conditioned model is trained with text prompt p with the following loss function</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{z_t^I,\, z_T^A,\, \epsilon^I \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1),\, t,\, p}
\left[\left\lVert \epsilon - \epsilon_{\theta}^{S}\big(z_t^I, z_T^A, t, p\big) \right\rVert_{2}^{2}\right]
$$
</div>
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:0.9em;"><em>Loss function for the Stable Diffusion model
</em></p>

<p>The second stage employs a ControlNet to guide the diffusion model using user scribbles and surface normal maps. Using a learnable Control Encoder, the normals and user scribbles are concatenated into a lighting feature map. Then, using the image latent code, text prompt p, and Stable Diffusion weights, the ControlNet is trained with the following loss function</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{D} + \mathbb{E}_{z_t,\, f,\, \epsilon^I \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1),\, t,\, p}
\left[\left\lVert \epsilon - \epsilon_{\theta}^{C}\big(z_t, f, t, p\big) \right\rVert_{2}^{2}\right]
$$
</div>
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:0.9em;"><em>Loss function for the ControlNet
</em></p>

<p>To train the model, real indoor images from LSUN Bedrooms were used. After creating the albedo maps for each image, text prompts with BLIP-2, normals with DSINE, and shading with an IID, sample user scribbles are generated with the following criteria</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
$$
M(x) =
\begin{cases}
1, &amp; \text{if } I(x) &gt; u + o,\\[6pt]
0, &amp; \text{if } I(x) &lt; u - o,\\[6pt]
0.5, &amp; \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$
</div>
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:0.9em;"><em>User scribble criteria
</em></p>

<p>With u and o as the mean and standard deviation of all pixels. Finally, an erosion and dilation with kernel sizes between 3 and 19 are performed to make the edges of the generated scribbles look more human.</p>

<p>The key advances of this implementation are that high - quality lighting effects are created from sparse inputs while respecting the “human”-like nature of images, i.e. the texture of objects in the room, the number of objects in the room, etc. Further, due to the use of Stable Diffusion, multiple replicas can be created from one input allowing users to select from multiple realistic images as to which one employed their scribbles in the best possible manner. Specifically, stage 1 using albedo + noise uncertainty ensures that the Stable Diffusion model has variation within its lit areas while preserving the key textures / objects / colors  in the original image. Stage 2 using ControlNet allows for ScribbleLight to build up from the generated image and incorporate user scribbles effectively. The Decoder is then forced to reconstruct the normal map and shading from the light features from the encoder fed input; this forces the latent map to encapsulate 3d geometry rather than 2d patterns.</p>

<p>With the manually and auto-generated user scribbles on the LSUN Bedrooms images, ScribbleLight was tested against LightIt with the auto-generated scribble annotations and RGB&lt;-&gt;x without retraining using normal, albedo, roughness, and metallicity components. Further, RMSE, PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS were used to quantitatively test error. In order, these measure pixel by pixel similarity, amount of noise in the image, structure of neighborhoods on pixels, and feature difference in deep layers. Thus, low RMSE + high PSNR indicate good pixel similarity while high SSIM and low LPIPS indicate that generated images maintain structure and have good features.</p>

<p style="width: 640px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/14/image-0084.png" alt="Lighting-aware architecture" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:0.9em;"><em> Quantitative results of employing models on test images.
</em></p>

<p>Qualitatively, ScribbleLight preserves the albedo of images and is able to generate plausible light  / shadows considering light sources that are both in / out of images. Further, given a single image, ScribbleLight is able to iteratively generate better lighting and also based on different provided user scribbles create plausible scenarios. Finally, ablation testing by removing albedo noise, the control-decoder, and normals illustrated that each step in the pipeline contributed to meaningful improvements. Specifically, the albedo noise preserves the texture of the input image and the decoder/normals preserve the objects in the image.</p>

<p style="width: 640px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/14/image-0087.png" alt="Lighting-aware architecture" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:0.9em;"><em>Qualitative results of employing models on test images.
</em></p>

<p>ScribbleLight fails to rectify inconsistencies with user-generated scribbles and plausible light sources in the image. Further, ScribbleLight is biased towards common light colors(i.e. White, blue). However, ScribbleLight preserves texture and color of input images better than any current models. The ability of ScribbleLight to generate multiple version is additionally extremely beneficial for users seeking to add lighting / shadow to their images and iterate over multiple versions without spending exorbitant amounts of time.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>The studied methods collectively reveal a clear trend toward ML editing systems that better reflect the constraints of studio photography. Instead of relying solely on generic inpainting, recent approaches increasingly account for large uniform backgrounds, controlled lighting, and complex interactions such as shadows and reflections. LaMa demonstrates how globally aware architectures can more effectively fill large missing regions common in studio object removal, while SmartEraser and OmniEraser show a shift toward models that preserve visibility into the removed object so the system can avoid regeneration artifacts and correctly handle lighting effects. The “No Shadow Left Behind: Removing Objects and Their Shadows Using Approximate Lighting and Geometry” paper contributes a complementary view by highlighting that even when object removal succeeds, the leftover shadows often break realism. Its use of shadow segmentation, intrinsic decomposition, and shadow removal networks reveals the need for explicit lighting modeling to handle multiple lights and complex shadow behavior. DreamPainter and ScribbleLight further highlight the growing use of richer conditioning signals such as text, reference images, masks, albedo, normals, and user scribbles in order to give editors more precise control than what traditional mask-only pipelines allow. These developments suggest a progression toward multimodal, lighting-aware, and context-sensitive editing tools designed specifically for studio-quality images.</p>

<p>At the same time, the methods highlight several persistent technical challenges. One difficulty is maintaining global structural consistency when large regions of an image are removed, a problem LaMa tackles through its use of large receptive fields. The shadow-removal paper demonstrates that shadows are particularly difficult because they depend on material, geometry, and multi-light interactions; inaccurate 3D proxies make classical methods unreliable. SmartEraser identifies the issue that models often hallucinate new objects or distort the background when they cannot see the removed region, while OmniEraser addresses the long-standing challenge that most methods struggle to eliminate shadows and reflections in a realistic way. DreamPainter points out that models trained on generic datasets often fail to maintain product fidelity or studio lighting consistency, and ScribbleLight illustrates the complexity of controlling lighting effects based on sparse user inputs while preserving fine texture and geometry. These issues show that both physical properties such as shadows, reflections, and illumination and global context remain difficult for current systems to accurately reconstruct.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, the papers complement one another in ways that outline a promising multi-stage pipeline for studio editing. LaMa offers a strong foundation for filling background structure after object removal. SmartEraser extends this by preventing the regeneration of the object and ensuring the background remains coherent. The shadow-removal paper supplies a mechanism for identifying and eliminating shadows tied to the removed object. OmniEraser then adds the ability to remove shadows and reflections, which the earlier methods do not explicitly address. DreamPainter can then be used to generate or refine backgrounds with high stylistic or lighting consistency while preserving the foreground product. ScribbleLight provides fine-grained, user-controlled relighting to finalize the scene. Together, these models form a chain of capabilities that span structural reconstruction, semantic understanding, lighting-aware removal, background generation, and interactive lighting control.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Taken together, the reviewed methods outline substantial progress in ML-based studio photo editing but also reveal clear opportunities for future advancement. None of the current models provide a unified approach that removes objects, eliminates shadows, maintains global structure, generates consistent backgrounds, and offers precise user controlled lighting within a single system. The reliance on synthetic or video based datasets also highlights the difficulty of acquiring high-quality, studio specific training data, especially when realistic shadow behavior is required. DreamPainter demonstrates the advantages of domain specific datasets and multimodal conditioning, suggesting that future systems could incorporate reference lighting cues or per-shoot calibration images. ScribbleLight’s limitations with inconsistent scribbles and uncommon light colors, along with the fact that OmniEraser and LaMa do not explicitly model lighting geometry, point to further opportunities for integrating physical lighting reasoning with flexible user controls. Ultimately, these findings suggest a promising direction toward holistic, studio-aware editing models capable of unifying structural, semantic, and illumination related reasoning within a single end-to-end framework.</p>

However, even in controlled environments, unwanted objects such as chairs, props, wires, etc., often appear in the scene.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Instance segmentation is a core computer vision task that separates each individual object in an image at the pixel level. In a sense, this computer vision task combines the problems of object detection, where the model identifies all the objects in an image, and semantic segmentation, where the model detects the pixels that belong to each object. Due to instance segmentation outlining every distinct object in an image, it is useful for a model to gain a deeper visual understanding of a complex scene. This makes it particularly essential for applications like self-driving cars, medical imaging, and robotics.</p>

<p>Early research in instance segmentation adopted the approach of a two-stage detector by using defined object detection and semantic segmentation methods. This approach is primarily known through Mask R-CNN, which uses baseline object detection frameworks with an additional component for pixel level mask prediction. Specifically, Mask R-CNN uses Faster R-CNN as the object detector model, which includes a Region Proposal Network, RoI Align, and CNN layers in its structure. Mask R-CNN then adds a mask head branch that generates a mask for each object instance in parallel to the classification and bounding box regression heads. However, Mask R-CNN is slow, limiting its real-time use on complex or large objects. This motivated the development of one-stage instance segmentation methods, such as SOLO (Segmenting Objects by Locations), to focus on improving the slower speed of two-stage methods. One-stage methods, like SOLO, use a more direct approach of outputting instance masks and class probabilities in a single pass. This one-pass method eliminates the process of grouping, anchor boxes, and convolutions that were present in Mask R-CNN.</p>

<p>Recent advances in deep learning have substantially influenced the landscape of instance segmentation. Significant examples of this are through transformer based architectures and large scale pretraining. Due to this, the realm of instance segmentation has been advancing year by year. In this paper, we synthesize three influential directions in instance segmentation research. These paper topics cover Segment Anything, which is a “promptable” image segmentation model, Mask2Former, which provides a universal, non-specialized architecture for image segmentation, and instance segmentation methods for point clouds, which extend visual data understanding to a 3D level.</p>

<h2 id="segment-anything-model">Segment Anything Model</h2>

<h3 id="historical-context-and-motivation">Historical Context and Motivation</h3>
<p>The development of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) by Meta can be traced back to the company’s origins in 2004, when it was still known as Facebook. As a social media platform, Facebook rapidly evolved into one of the world’s largest repositories of visual data. This rapidly motivated early investment in computer vision, through applications such as automated photo tagging and content moderation, and later through more advanced machine learning systems. By the mid-2010s, the establishment of Facebook AI Research (FAIR) marked a shift toward foundational AI research, with FAIR becoming a leading contributor to advances in self-supervised learning, computer vision, and large-scale deep learning. After Facebook’s rebrand to Meta in 2021, the company’s long-term vision expanded toward spatial computing, AR/VR systems in the form of Meta glasses, increasing the demand for models capable of robustly understanding objects, scenes, and their interactions in the physical world. Soon, Meta introduced the Segment Anything Model (SAM) as a new model for image segmentation.</p>
<h3 id="sam-architecture">SAM Architecture</h3>
<p>SAM uses an encoder-decoder framework with separation between image encoding, prompt encoding, and mask decoding, enabling efficient reuse of image features across multiple segmentation queries. Essentially, SAM is a Vision Transformer (ViT) image encoder, which processes an input image \(I \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times 3}\) into a dense latent representation \(E_I \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D}\), where \(N\) is the number of image tokens and \(D\) the embedding dimension. With multi-head self-attention, the ViT captures long-range spatial dependencies, and allows SAM to model global context beyond local receptive fields from convolutional networks. SAM is pretrained on a large corpus of image–mask pairs and leverages masked autoencoding and self-supervised learning objectives to learn robust visual representations [1]. This allows for SAM to achieve strong generalization for many different objects and stronger reliability, from its trained inputs.
User interaction is added via a prompt encoder, which embeds sparse and dense prompts into the same latent space as the image embeddings. Sparse prompts with small pieces of information, including background and foreground points, are encoded using positional embeddings and lightweight MLPs, while dense prompts, like low-resolution masks of objects, are embedded using convolutional layers. These influence the segmentation process while leaving the image encoder unchanged.</p>

<p><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/17/Figure2.png" alt="YOLO" />
Fig 1. SAM Overview [1]</p>

<p>The mask decoder is implemented as a lightweight transformer that performs cross-attention between the prompt embeddings and image embeddings. Given query tokens derived from the prompts, the decoder looks at relevant spatial regions in \(E_I\) and predicts a set of candidate segmentation masks along with corresponding confidence scores. To handle ambiguity, SAM also outputs multiple mask hypotheses per prompt and ranks them using a predicted mask quality score, usually modeled as an estimated Intersection-over-Union (IoU). Formally, mask prediction can be expressed as:
\(M = \text{Decoder}(E_I, E_P)\)<br />
where \(E_P\)​ is the encoded prompts and \(M\) represents the predicted binary masks. By separating image encoding from prompt-based decoding, SAM stays computationally efficient while handling a wide range of segmentation tasks.
Despite its strong generalization capabilities, SAM primarily models segmentation as an appearance-driven, prompt-conditioned task. Interactions between multiple instances are handled implicitly through attention over image tokens, without needing to enforce explicit relational or structural constraints. This limitation can result in overlapping or redundant masks in complex scenes, motivating subsequent extensions.</p>
<h3 id="sam2-memory-augmented-video-segmentation">SAM2: Memory-Augmented Video Segmentation</h3>

<p><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/17/Figure3.png" alt="YOLO" />
Fig 2. SAM 2 Overview [2]</p>

<p>To address temporal consistency, SAM2 expands the original architecture to video and sequential data by introducing a memory-augmented segmentation framework. This stores and recalls features from previous time stamps to allow the model to maintain context and ensure consistent object segmentation across sequences. While keeping the same image encoder, prompt encoder, and mask decoder, SAM2 adds a temporal memory bank that stores embeddings, predicted masks, and object identity information from previous frames [2]. While inferring frames, the decoder simultaneously focuses on the current frame’s image embeddings and relevant memory entries, enabling information to propagate across time. For a frame at time tt, mask prediction can be written as:
\(M_t=\text{Decoder}(E_{I_t},E_{P_t},M_{t−1})\)
where \(M_{t−1}\)​ denotes stored memory from prior frames. This design enhances resilience to occlusion, motion, and changes in appearance, all while preserving amortized efficiency. However, SAM2’s relational reasoning is primarily temporal and does not explicitly model spatial relationships between multiple instances within a single frame.</p>
<h3 id="sam3-structured-relational-reasoning-via-pcs-and-pvs">SAM3: Structured Relational Reasoning via PCS and PVS</h3>

<p><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/17/Figure4.png" alt="YOLO" />
Fig 3. Illustration of supported initial and optional interactive refinement prompts in the PCS task [3]</p>

<p>Building on this foundation, SAM3 further strengthens intra-frame relational modeling and expands the Segment Anything framework through two complementary tasks: Promptable Consistent Segmentation (PCS) and Promptable Video Segmentation (PVS). In PCS, SAM3 jointly refines multiple candidate masks using cross-mask attention, allowing the model to reason explicitly about overlap, redundancy, and spatial consistency between instances [3]. This structured decoding process reduces fragmented or conflicting predictions, particularly in crowded scenes or under ambiguous prompts.
PVS extends this relational reasoning into the temporal domain. While SAM2 introduces memory for video segmentation, SAM3 combines temporal memory attention with intra-frame cross-mask interactions, enabling more stable and identity-preserving segmentation across frames. This unified treatment improves robustness to occlusions and object interactions while maintaining spatial coherence within each frame.
Together, the progress from SAM to SAM2 and SAM3 reflects a shift from independent, appearance-driven segmentation toward increasingly structured and relation-aware modeling. Although SAM3 significantly improves spatial and temporal reasoning in 2D image and video domains, its relational understanding remains largely implicit and attention-based, lacking explicit geometric or physical priors. This limitation motivates further exploration of architectures that encode explicit relational structure, particularly in domains such as 3D instance segmentation, where spatial relationships and object geometry are fundamental to scene understanding.</p>

<h2 id="all-in-one-mask2former">All in One: Mask2Former</h2>
<p>As instance segmentation research has progressed from object-proposal based approaches such as Mask R-CNN to prompt driven systems like Segment Anything, a complementary research direction has focused on designing universal frameworks capable of solving semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation within a single model. Meta’s Masked Attention Mask Transformer, or Mask2Former, represents a significant advancement in this direction [4]. It introduces a unified meta architecture that achieves state of the art performance across all major two dimensional segmentation tasks using a single, task agnostic formulation. Figure 4 illustrates the differences between semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation tasks, highlighting the motivation and performance for a unified segmentation framework. 
<img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/17/Figure5.png" alt="YOLO" />

<h3 id="unified-segmentation-architecture">Unified Segmentation Architecture</h3>
<p><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/17/Figure6.png" alt="YOLO" />
Fig 5: Overview of the Mask2Former meta architecture, consisting of a backbone, pixel decoder, and transformer decoder with masked attention [4].</p>

<p>As shown in Figure 5, Mask2Former consists of a backbone network, pixel decoder, and a transformer decoder operating on a fixed set of learned queries. Mask2Former formulates segmentation as a direct set prediction problem, inspired by detection transformers but adapted for dense pixel-level output [4]. Instead of relying on task specific heads or heuristics, the model predicts a fixed size set of segmentation masks and corresponding class labels. These predictions can be interpreted uniformly for semantic, instance, or panoptic segmentation. The overall meta architecture is composed of three primary components.
a. The backbone network extracts hierarchical and multi scale feature representations from the input image. Both convolutional and transformer based backbones can be used, with Swin Transformer being a common choice due to its strong multi-scale representations.
b. The pixel decoder aggregates features from multiple backbone stages into a unified high resolution pixel embedding. This step preserves fine spatial details while efficiently combining contextual information across scales, which is critical for accurate mask prediction.
c. The transformer decoder operates on a fixed set of learned query embeddings. Each query represents a potential segmentation region and is iteratively refined through attention mechanisms to predict both a segmentation mask and an associated class label. This design allows the same set of queries to support all segmentation tasks without requiring architectural changes.</p>
<h4 id="masked-attention-mechanism">Masked Attention Mechanism</h4>
<p>The primary contribution of Mask2Former is the introduction of masked attention within the transformer decoder [4]. In standard transformer based segmentation models, cross-attention is computed globally over all pixel features. This global attention can introduce irrelevant background information and reduce localization accuracy, particularly for small objects or complex shapes. Figure 6 contrasts standard global cross attention with the masked attention mechanism used in Mask2Former.<br />
<img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/17/Figure7.png" alt="YOLO" />
Fig 6: Comparison between global cross attention (on top) and masked attention (on bottom), where attention is restricted to predicted foreground regions [4].</p>

<p>Masked attention addresses this limitation by restricting each query to attend only to the spatial regions corresponding to its predicted mask from the previous decoding stage. Formally, Mask2Former implements masked attention by modulating the standard cross-attention operation with a spatial mask derived from the previous decoder layer [4]. The masked cross-attention update at the layer \(l\) is defined as</p>

\[X_l = \text{softmax}(M_{l-1} + Q_l K_l^\top) V_l + X_{l-1}\]

\[M_{l-1}(x, y) = \begin{cases} 0, &amp; \text{if } \hat{M}_{l-1}(x, y) = 1 \\ -\infty, &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\]

<p>Here, \(Q_l\), \(K_l\), and \(V_l\) denote the query, key, and value projections at decoder layer \(l\), and \(X_{l-1}\) represents the residual connection from the previous layer. The mask \(M_{l-1}\) is constructed from the predicted segmentation mask of the previous decoding stage and is added directly to the attention logits. Spatial locations outside the predicted foreground region are assigned a value of \(-\infty\), effectively suppressing their contribution after the softmax operation. As a result, each query attends only to features within its predicted object region.​​
By constraining attention in this way, the model achieves two important benefits.
First, masked attention encourages localized feature extraction. Each query focuses on features within its predicted foreground region, enabling the model to learn more discriminative and object specific representations. This results in faster convergence and improved segmentation accuracy.
Next, masked attention improves computational efficiency by avoiding unnecessary attention computations over background regions. This reduction in redundant computation leads to more efficient training and inference compared to fully global attention.
Mask2Former further incorporates several complementary design choices that contribute to its strong performance. These include the use of multi scale features in a round robin manner across decoder layers and a point based sampling strategy for mask loss computation [4]. The latter significantly reduces GPU memory usage during training while maintaining segmentation accuracy.</p>
<h3 id="performance-and-significance">Performance and Significance</h3>
<p>By combining masked attention with a unified set prediction formulation, Mask2Former becomes the first segmentation model to consistently outperform specialized task specific architectures across semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation benchmarks. Its success demonstrates that a unified, query based approach can exceed the performance of fragmented pipelines designed for individual tasks. As a result, Mask2Former has established an influential framework for subsequent transformer based segmentation research and has reinforced the viability of universal segmentation architectures.</p>

<h2 id="new-frontiers-in-instance-segmentation-relation3d">New Frontiers in Instance Segmentation: Relation3D</h2>

<p>We’ve seen how instance segmentation has advanced in 2D, but we can apply similar principles to conduct instance segmentation in a 3D space as well, specifically in the more unordered, and sparse input of 3D point clouds. This kind of segmentation task has massive implications for rapidly growing technologies, including robotic spatial understanding and autonomous driving. To solve this problem, transformer-based methods have primarily been the focus due to the ubiquity of their pipelines and generally high performance. However, they primarily use mask attention to model external relationships between features, ignoring internal relationships i.e the connections between scene features and the spatial relationships between the queries. Other 2D segmentation methods have explored relation modeling and underscored its importance, but relation priors in 3D instance segmentation have been largely unexplored in research until now.</p>

<p>Relation3D is a new architecture proposed in a titular CVPR 2025 paper that aims to better represent the missing links between these features and improve spatial understanding in transformer-based 3D point cloud instance segmentation.</p>

<p><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/17/Figure8.png" alt="YOLO" />

<h3 id="better-scene-features-asam--clsr">Better Scene Features (ASAM &amp; CLSR)</h3>
<p>First, we reevaluate traditional aggregation methods of point clouds into “superpoints,” which usually use simple pooling that ends up blurring out important details or mistakenly incorporating noise into the reduced point cloud space. The new proposed Adaptive Superpoint Aggregation Module (ASAM) in Relation3D calculates adaptive weights for each point within a group, comparing with the pooled max and mean to learn weights that emphasize edges and corners [5].</p>

<p>Then a Contrastive Learning-guided Superpoint Refinement (CLSR) module is employed to act as a dual path loop for superpoint features and query features to interact with each other and update their information, improving superpoint features’ consistency within object instances and the differences between features of different instances. This process is guided using a contrastive loss function:</p>

\[L_{cont} = BCE\left(\frac{\mathcal{S}+1}{2}, R_{super}^{GT}\right)\]

<p>where \(\mathcal{S}\) is a similarity matrix of superpoint features and \(R_{super}^{GT}\)
is ground truth relation matrix from instance annotations.</p>

<p><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/17/Figure9.png" alt="YOLO" />

<h3 id="improved-query-interactions-with-relation-aware-self-attention-rsa">Improved Query Interactions with Relation-Aware Self-Attention (RSA)</h3>
<p>Typical self-attention mechanisms rely on position embeddings that often lack concrete spatial meaning. The proposed RSA injects explicit geometric priors into the attention mechanism to accelerate convergence and improve accuracy [5].</p>
<ul>
  <li>Geometric Priors: The model calculates the bounding box for each query’s predicted mask (center \(x,y,z\) and scale \(l,w,h\))20.</li>
  <li>Relative Relationships: It computes explicit relationships between two queries \(i\) and \(j\). For example, the positional relationship is defined as:</li>
</ul>

\[\text{Pos}_{rel} = \left[ \log\left(\frac{|x_i - x_j|}{l_i} + 1\right), \dots \right]\]

<p>Similar log-ratios are calculated for geometric scales (length, width, height)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Attention Mechanism: These relationships form an embedding \(R_q\) that is injected directly into the self-attention calculation:</li>
</ul>

\[RSA(Q) = \text{Softmax}\left(\frac{\mathcal{Q}\mathcal{K}^T}{\sqrt{d}} + R_q\right)\mathcal{V}\]

<p>This allows the model to learn and attend to physical proximity and geometric similarity, in addition to just semantic similarity.

<p>Relation3D is noted as achieving better performance on standard benchmarks like ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, and S3DIS than previous transformer-based approaches, demonstrating the efficacy of relation-aware approaches to instance segmentation in the 3D space [5].</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Through this paper, we have thoroughly examined three developments in instance segmentation research. Segment Anything demonstrates using large scale pretraining and prompt based interaction for better generalization performance on new tasks. However, SAM faces a limitation in its relational understanding between multiple instances being largely implicit. Relation 3D is a newly proposed architecture that brings instance segmentation to the unordered and sparse point cloud data domain. Here, Relation3D incorporates explicit geometric priors with relation-aware self-attention to encourage strong spatial understanding in 3D point cloud data. Mask2Former is a universal architecture that combines semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation capabilities within a single model. It importantly adds a masked attention mechanism that helps improve computational efficiency and improves localization. The topics discussed in this paper report provide examples of a push toward methods that are more generalizable, universal, and applicable within instance segmentation problems.</p>
