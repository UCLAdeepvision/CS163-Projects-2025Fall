        <blockquote>
  <p>Vision-based learning has become a central paradigm for enabling robots to operate in complex, unstructured environments. Rather than relying on hand-engineered perception pipelines or task-specific supervision, recent work increasingly leverages large-scale video data to learn transferable visual representations and predictive models for control. This survey reviews a sequence of recent approaches that illustrate this progression: learning control directly from video demonstrations, pretraining universal visual representations, incorporating predictive dynamics through visual point tracking, and augmenting learning with synthetic visual data. Together, these works highlight how representation learning and prediction from video are enabling increasingly generalizable robot manipulation capabilities.</p>

        <blockquote>
  <p>Super-resolution has long faced a fundamental tension: the highest-quality models require billions of operations, while edge devices demand sub-100ms inference. This article examines three recent methods—SPAN, EFDN, and DSCLoRa—that challenge this tradeoff through architectural innovation, training-time tricks, and efficient adaptation. We’ll see how rethinking the upsampling operation, leveraging structural reparameterization, and applying low-rank decomposition can each dramatically improve efficiency without sacrificing output quality.</p>

        <blockquote>
  <p>Facial Recognition (FR) systems are being increasingly used in high stake environments, but their decision making processes remain a mystery, raising concerns regarding trust, bias, and robustness. Traditional methods such as occlusion sensitivity or saliency maps (e.g., Grad-CAM), often fail to capture the causal mechanisms driving verification decisions or diagnosis reliance on shortcuts. This report analyzes three modern paradigms that shift Explainable AI (XAI) from passive visualization to active, feature level interrogation. We examined FastDiME [5] which utilizes generative diffusion models to create counterfactuals for detecting shortcut learning, Feature Guided Gradient Backpropagation (FGGB) [3], which mitigates vanishing gradients to produce similarity and dissimilarity maps, and Frequency Domain Explainability [2], which introduces Frequency Heat Plots (FHPs) to diagnose biases in CNNs. By synthesizing these approaches, we examine how modern XAI tools can assess model reliance on noise versus structural identity, with the goal of offering a pathway toward more robust and transparent biometric systems.</p>

  <p>The evolution from Mask R-CNN to SAM represents a paradigm shift in computer vision segmentation, moving from supervised specialists constrained by fixed vocabularies to promptable generalists that operate class-agnostically.

  <p>[Project Tack] Historically, novel view synthesis (NVS) has relied on volumetric radiance field approaches, such as NeRF. While effective, these methods are often computationally expensive to train and prohibitively slow to render for real-time applications. To address these limitations, researchers have developed new architectures that reduce computational costs while maintaining or exceeding visual fidelity. This report examines two distinct solutions to this challenge: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and the Large View Synthesis Model (LVSM).</p>

  <p>Medical image segmentation is an important component in the medical field, supporting the diagnosis of patients, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. Segmentation in machine learning is a process where datasets are broken into meaningful groups for annotation and deeper analysis. Medical segmentation, a combination of the two, has grown to importance in the field, but there still remains a challenging problem due to the large variability in modalities, anatomical structures, and usage.
