<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Deep learning is a field that learns pattern and representations from data, and many of its breakthrough have relied on supervised learning. However, supervised learning depends on massive labeled datasets, and creating these labels is often expensive, time-consuming, and requires expertise. In many real situations, most datasets are unlabeled, which makes supervised learning difficult to apply in many practical situations. Therefore, self-supervised learning was developed to address this challenge. Instead of relying on human annotations, self-supervised learning creates pretext tasks that force the model to learn meaningful structure directly from the data itself. By doing this, the model can learn general and useful representations that can be applied to downstream tasks.</p>

<p>Other than self-supervised learning, semi-supervised learning is also a useful way to train a model when labeled data is not sufficient. It uses both labeled and unlabeled data during training. In general, a semi-supervised learning workflow starts by training the model on the labeled data and then using the model’s own predictions to guide learning on the unlabeled data. Popular semi-supervised approaches include pseudo-labeling, consistency regularization. In practice, semi-supervised learning is preferred when at least some labels exist and we want to boost performance by adding unlabeled data. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, is more suitable when obtaining labels is very difficult or expensive. In this paper, we will focus on several popular methods in self-supervised learning and discuss why they have become strong alternatives to fully supervised and semi-supervised approaches.</p>

<h2 id="contrastive-learning-simclr">Contrastive Learning (SimCLR)</h2>

<h3 id="1-model-structure">1. Model Structure</h3>
<p>SimCLR is a self-supervised learning method built on contrastive representation learning. Its core idea is to make representations of different augmented views of the same image closer while pushing apart representations of different images.</p>

<p><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team40/simclr.png" alt="SimCLR Pipeline" />
<em>Fig 1. SimCLR: Overview of SimCLR Framework</em> [1].</p>

<h4 id="encoder">Encoder</h4>
<p>A base encoder extracts features from each augmented view. This encoder learns meaningful visual representations without labels.</p>

<h4 id="projection-head">Projection Head</h4>
<p>The encoder output is passed into a small MLP projection head:</p>

\[z = \text{MLP}(h)\]

<p>This projection improves the quality of contrastive learning; the encoder’s representation $h$ is used for downstream tasks.</p>

<h4 id="nt-xent-contrastive-loss">NT-Xent Contrastive loss</h4>
<p>SimCLR uses the NT-Xent (Normalized Temperature-Scaled Cross Entropy) loss to maximize similarity between positive pairs and minimize similarity with negative samples:</p>

\[\ell_{i,j}
= - \log 
\frac{
    \exp(\operatorname{sim}(z_i, z_j)/\tau)
}{
    \sum_{k \neq i} \exp(\operatorname{sim}(z_i, z_k)/\tau)
}\]

<p>$\tau$ is the temperature parameter controlling distribution sharpness.
sim() is cosine similarity.
(i, j) is a positive pair, and all augumented images in the batch act as negatives.</p>

<h3 id="2-workflow">2. Workflow</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Sample a batch of N images.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Applying two independently sampled data augmentations to each image. 
\(x \rightarrow x_i',\, x_j'\)
This produces two correlated views of the same image, which form a positive pair. All other augmented images in the batch serve as negative examples.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each augmented view is passed through the encoder to obtain representations:</p>

\[h = f_{\text{encoder}}(x')\]
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The projection head maps representations into a contrastive space:</p>

\[z = g_{\text{proj}}(h)\]
  </li>
  <li>SimCLR uses the NT-Xent loss to increase similarity between positive pairs and decrease similarity with negative samples.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="3-key-findings">3. Key Findings</h3>
<p>Importance of Large Batch Sizes: SimCLR demonstrates that more negative samples is better for contrastive learning. However, training large batch using standard SGD/Momentum is unstable. Therefore, SimCLR uses LARS optimizer.</p>

<p>Data Augumentation is essential: SimCLR relies on strong augmentations (crop, color jitter, Gaussian blur, etc.) to create meaningful positive pairs. No single augmentation (e.g., only cropping or only color jitter) is sufficient to learn high-quality representations. The model can still solve the contrastive prediction task with high accuracy, but the representations remain poor unless augmentations are combined. A particularly important finding is that the composition of random cropping + random color distortion produces the strongest results.</p>

<p><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team40/simclr_aug.png" alt="SimCLR Aug" />
<em>Fig 2. Impact of combining data augmentations on representation quality in SimCLR</em> [1].</p>

<h2 id="masked-image-modelling-mae">Masked Image Modelling (MAE)</h2>

<h3 id="1-model-structure-1">1. Model Structure</h3>

<p>Masked Autoencoders are a self-supervised learning method for masked image modeling. The model learns to reconstruct missing image patches using only a subset of visible patches.</p>

<p><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team40/mae.png" alt="SimCLR Aug" />
<em>Fig 2. Architecture of Masked Autoencoders (MAE)</em> [2].</p>

<h4 id="asymmetric-encoder">Asymmetric Encoder</h4>
<p>The encoder is a ViT that only processes visible patches. Because only small part of image is visible to encoder when using high masking ratio, the encoder computation and memory cost are substantially reduced. The encoder learns semantic, high-level features without being forced to memorize low-level pixel statistics.</p>

<h4 id="lightweight-decoder">Lightweight Decoder</h4>
<p>The decoder receives both the encoded visible patch embeddings and a set of mask tokens that represent missing patches. Mask tokens are shared learned vectors with positional embeddings indicates where a patch should appear. The decoder reconstructs pixel values for all patches, and its output dimension equals the number of pixels per patch, which is later reshaped back into image format. The decoder is used only during pre-training, not for downstream tasks.</p>

<h4 id="normalized-pixel-reconstruction-variant">Normalized Pixel Reconstruction Variant</h4>
<p>MAE also evaluates reconstruction using normalized pixel values rather than raw RGB pixel values.</p>

\[\tilde{x} = \frac{x - \mu_{\text{patch}}}{\sigma_{\text{patch}}}\]

<p>Using normalized targets prevents the model from overfitting to global color biases and encourages learning of structure, texture, and spatial patterns, which are more useful for downstream tasks.</p>

<h3 id="2-workflow-1">2. Workflow</h3>

<p>The MAE pre-training pipeline works as follow:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Split input image into non-overlapping patches and convert them into token via linear projection.</li>
  <li>Random shuffle patch tokens and select a subset as visible tokens; rest of patches will be masked.</li>
  <li>Feed only the visible patch tokens into the ViT encoder. The encoder will output latent representations for visible patches.</li>
  <li>Create mask tokens for all removed patches and append mask tokens to encoder outputs.</li>
  <li>Unshuffle the sequence to restore the original spatial ordering.</li>
  <li>Feed the visible embeddings + mask tokens into decoder.</li>
  <li>The decoder predicts pixel values for all patches.</li>
  <li>Compute MSE loss only using masked patches.
For Masked patches M,</li>
</ol>

\[L_{\text{MAE}}
= \frac{1}{|M|}
\sum_{i \in M}
\lVert \hat{x}_i - x_i \rVert^{2}\]

<h3 id="3-key-findings-and-results">3. Key Findings and Results</h3>

<p>Experiment Setting:
Pre-training performed on ImageNet-1K using ViT-Large (ViT-L/16) as the backbone.<br />
Evaluated with: 1) Linear probing: training a linear classifier on frozen encoder features. 2) Fine-tuning: updating the entire encoder on downstream tasks.</p>

<p>Masking Ratio: A very high masking ratio of around 75% works best for both linear probing and fine-tuning, which shows that MAE benefits from massive masking. In addition, the authors show that an MAE pre-trained with a 75% mask ratio can still produce plausible reconstructions even when evaluated with much higher masking ratios. The model generates semantically reasonable predictions that differ plausibly from the original images, demonstrating strong generalization of the learned representations.</p>

<p><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team40/mask_ratio.png" alt="SimCLR Aug" />
<em>Fig 2. MAE reconstructions under increasing masking ratios</em> [2].</p>

<p>Decoder Depth: A shallow decoder yields weaker linear-probing accuracy because the encoder must learn too many low-level details that should normally be handled by the decoder.</p>

<p>Mask Token Placement: Adding mask tokens after the encoder is better than adding them before. This is because encoder processes only real image data, which improves representation quality and save memory and compute.</p>

<p>Normalized Pixel Targets: Predicting normalized pixel values significantly improves reconstruction quality and downstream performance, as encoder is encouraged to learn structure, shape, and texture, instead of memorizing absolute pixel colors.</p>

<p>Minimal Augumentation: MAE performs well without strong data augmentation. Unlike contrastive learning (e.g., SimCLR), MAE relies primarily on the masking operation as its augmentation.</p>

<h2 id="dino-self-distillation-with-no-labels">DINO: self-distillation with no labels</h2>

<p>DINO (self-distillation with no labels) is a self-supervised learning framework based on knowledge co-distillation, where a student network is trained to match the output distribution produced by a teacher network. <br />
Both networks share the same architecture (e.g., ViT or ResNet) and consist of a backbone encoder followed by a projection head.</p>

<h3 id="model-structure">Model Structure</h3>

<p><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/team40/dino.png" alt="SimCLR Aug" />
<em>Fig 5. Teacher-Student Training Framework in DINO</em> [3].</p>

<h4 id="teacher-student-symmetry">Teacher-Student Symmetry</h4>
<p>Student and teacher have identical network structures. Only the student receives gradient updates via SGD. The teacher parameters are updated using an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student:</p>

\[\theta_{\text{teacher}} \leftarrow \alpha \theta_{\text{teacher}} + (1-\alpha)\theta_{\text{student}}\]

<p>where \(\alpha\) follows a cosine schedule increasing from 0.996 to 1.</p>

<h4 id="output-distribution">Output distribution</h4>
<p>Both networks produce a probability distribution by applying a softmax with temperature:</p>

\[P = \text{softmax}\!\left(\frac{z}{\tau}\right)\]

<p>The student uses a higher temperature \(\tau\) to avoid over-confidence, while the teacher uses a low temperature \(\tau\) to produce informative targets.</p>

<h4 id="risk-of-collapse">Risk of collapse</h4>
<p>Since DINO does not use negative samples, the embeddings for all images may collapse to a trivial uniform distribution to minimize loss. To avoid this, DINO introduces (1) Centering to prevent single-neuron domination (2) Sharpening to ensures teacher outputs are not uniform (3) EMA to provide stable targets.</p>

<h3 id="workflow">Workflow</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Given an input image, DINO generates a set of augmented views V: (1) Two global crops x₁ and x₂ (resolution 224 × 224), (2) multiple local crops (resolution 96 × 96).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teacher only processes global views, and student processes all crops. This asymmetry teaches the student viewpoint invariance and encourages learning high-level semantic representations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The objective is to make the student’s output distribution match the teacher’s across corresponding views. This is done by minimizing the cross enrtopy loss with respect to student network:</p>

\[L = - \sum_{k} P^{(t)}_{k} \log\left(P^{(s)}_{k}\right)\]
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Student network’s parameters are updated via SGD, and teacher network’s parameter are updated using EMA of student weights (no backpropagation).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both networks use a projection head (similar to SwAV) to produce the representations used for distillation. The backbone embeddings are used later for downstream tasks</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-findings--techniques">Key Findings &amp; techniques</h3>

<p>Avoiding Collapse:</p>

<p>DINO achieves non-trivial representations without negative samples by combining three stabilizing mechanisms:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Centering: Maintaining balanced activations across dimensions and preventing the model from collapsing to a single dominant feature or neuron.</li>
  <li>Sharpening: Using low-temperature softmax on teacher outputs to ensure teacher outputs are peaked and non-uniform.</li>
  <li>EMA Teacher Updating: Teacher parameters are updated slowly to provide stable optimization in training.</li>
</ol>
