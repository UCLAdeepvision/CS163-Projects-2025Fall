<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Embodied AI requires agents to perceive, reason, and act in realistic 3D environments.<br />
We use <strong>AI2-THOR</strong>, an interactive simulation containing kitchens, living rooms, bedrooms, and bathrooms.<br />
Our goal is to enable an agent to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify target objects using vision-language models (CLIP)</li>
  <li>Segment the target and surrounding context using SAM</li>
  <li>Understand spatial relationships (e.g., <em>“the laptop is on the sofa”</em>)</li>
  <li>Move toward the target using closed-loop visual feedback</li>
</ol>

<p>To achieve this, we integrate <strong>SAM</strong>, <strong>CLIP</strong>, and a custom spatial-reasoning module into a perception–action pipeline.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="computer-vision-model-architecture">Computer Vision Model Architecture</h2>

<h3 id="1-object-identification-with-clip">1. <strong>Object Identification with CLIP</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining) is a vision–language model trained to align images and text in a shared embedding space using large-scale contrastive learning. During training, CLIP learns two encoders (a visual encoder and a text encoder) that map images and natural language descriptions into a common latent space. The model is trained on millions of image–caption pairs by maximizing the similarity between matched image–text pairs while minimizing similarity between mismatched pairs. As a result, CLIP learns rich semantic representations that capture high-level visual concepts and their corresponding linguistic descriptions without relying on fixed class labels.</p>

<p>We use CLIP for object identification because embodied environments contain a large variety of object instances, appearances, and viewpoints that are impractical to enumerate with fixed category classifiers. CLIP’s joint vision–language embedding space enables open-vocabulary recognition, allowing the agent to generalize to unseen objects, synonyms, and varied visual contexts without retraining.</p>

<p style="width: 1000px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/29/CLIP.png" alt="CLIP Pipeline" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 1. CLIP identifies the target object using text–image similarity. (Image Credit: <a href="https://github.com/openai/CLIP">CLIP</a>)</em></p>

<p>Given a target command (e.g., <em>“find the microwave”</em>), the system:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Samples candidate bounding boxes</li>
  <li>Extracts embeddings via CLIP image encoder</li>
  <li>Computes similarity with the text embedding</li>
  <li>Selects the highest-scoring region as the target</li>
</ol>

<p>CLIP allows us to compute the semantic similarity between:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a text embedding (ex. cup), and</li>
  <li>an image embedding (ex. cropped SAM mask region).</li>
</ul>

<p>In our pipeline, SAM and CLIP serve complementary roles. SAM is responsible for proposing high-quality, class-agnostic object masks, while CLIP assigns semantic meaning to each mask by scoring its visual content against the language query. This separation allows precise spatial localization without sacrificing semantic flexibility.</p>

<p>For each candidate object mask \(m_i\) produced by SAM, we compute a semantic similarity score with the language query 
\(q\) using CLIP’s joint vision–language embedding space:</p>

\[s_i =
\frac{
f_{\text{img}}(m_i)^\top f_{\text{text}}(q)
}{
\left\lVert f_{\text{img}}(m_i) \right\rVert_2
\left\lVert f_{\text{text}}(q) \right\rVert_2
}\]

<p>where \(f_{\text{img}}(⋅)\) and \(f_{\text{text}}(⋅)\) denote the CLIP image and text encoders, respectively. The mask with the highest cosine similarity score is selected as the target object. We apply a softmax over similarity scores to normalize confidence across candidate masks and select the most likely target region. To improve robustness, CLIP similarity is computed on cropped SAM mask regions rather than the full image. This reduces background bias and ensures that similarity scores are dominated by object appearance rather than surrounding scene context, which is especially important in cluttered indoor environments.</p>

<p>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find_best_object</code> we evaluate our SAM mask crop against the test query.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>text_tokens = tokenizer([clean_query]).to(device)
image_inputs = torch.stack([clip_preprocess(img) for img in crops]).to(device)

with torch.no_grad():
    img_features = clip_model.encode_image(image_inputs)
    txt_features = clip_model.encode_text(text_tokens)

    img_features /= img_features.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
    txt_features /= txt_features.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)

    # Softmax over similarity scores
    probs = (100.0 * img_features @ txt_features.T).softmax(dim=0)
    values, indices = probs.topk(1)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By cleaning the text query and computing similarity scores, we can pick the highest scoring object mask to obtain our predicted object for the query. We use our best mask and score to draw our bounding boxes later as well as perform spatial reasoning and navigation. CLIP is also beneficial for our model because objects may be partially hidden, rotated, etc. in our robot simulation, and SAM alongside CLIP can determine whether a segment looks like the queried box. While CLIP provides strong semantic generalization, performance may degrade under severe occlusion, extreme viewpoint distortion, or visually ambiguous objects. To address these cases, our system leverages closed-loop navigation, allowing the agent to reposition and re-evaluate candidate masks from improved viewpoints.</p>

<h3 id="2-segmentation-with-sam-segment-anything">2. <strong>Segmentation with SAM (Segment Anything)</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a foundation model for image segmentation designed to produce high-quality, class-agnostic masks for arbitrary objects in an image. SAM consists of a large vision encoder and a lightweight mask decoder that can generate segmentation masks from flexible prompts such as points, bounding boxes, or coarse region proposals. Trained on a diverse dataset of images and masks, SAM generalizes across object categories and visual domains without task-specific retraining, enabling robust instance segmentation even for previously unseen objects. This makes SAM particularly well-suited for embodied environments, where object appearance, scale, and occlusion vary significantly across scenes.</p>

<p>After locating the target region, we refine the mask using SAM:</p>

<p style="width: 1000px; max-width: 100%;"><img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/29/sam_mask.png" alt="SAM Example" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 2. SAM generates class-agnostic instance segmentation masks from raw RGB frames, providing candidate object regions for CLIP-based semantic matching. (Image Credit: <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything">Segment Anything</a>)</em></p>

<p>To obtain object candidates in each frame, we use SAM as our instance segmengation module. SAM takes in a raw RGB frame from the RoboTHOR camera and then returns a set of high-quality segmentation masks, which we use for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Object localization</li>
  <li>Pixel-level spatial reasoning</li>
  <li>Deriving the agent’s navigation targets</li>
</ul>

<p>We use a ViT-H variant of SAM alongside a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SamAutomaticMaskGenerator</code>.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mask_generator = SamAutomaticMaskGenerator(
    sam,

    stability_score_thresh=0.3,
    box_nms_thresh=0.7,
    min_mask_region_area=400,
)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find_best_object</code> we use the bounding boxes associated with the segmentation masks generated by SAM to crop the original image. These cropped object images are then evaluated by CLIP.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>masks = mask_generator.generate(image_np)

    if w &lt; 10 or h &lt; 10:
        continue

    crop = Image.fromarray(image_np[y:y+h, x:x+w])
    crops.append(crop)
    valid_masks.append(mask_data)

<p><em>Fig 3. Comparison of raw camera input and SAM segmentation output.</em></p>

<p>Figure 3 illustrates the role of SAM in converting raw visual observations into structured object-level representations. As shown in Fig. 3a, the robot’s onboard RGB camera captures a cluttered indoor scene containing multiple objects with varying scales, occlusions, and lighting conditions. Fig. 3b demonstrates SAM’s ability to generate dense, class-agnostic instance segmentation masks, where each distinct object region is separated and highlighted. These masks provide precise spatial boundaries for candidate objects, enabling downstream modules, such as CLIP-based semantic matching, to operate on isolated object regions rather than the full image. By decoupling spatial localization from semantic labeling, SAM allows the system to robustly handle novel objects and complex scenes without relying on predefined category labels.</p>

<h3 id="3-spatial-relationship-detection">3. <strong>Spatial Relationship Detection</strong></h3>

<p>We extend the system to detect relations like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>“X is on Y”</em></li>
  <li><em>“X is next to Y”</em></li>
  <li><em>“X is inside Y”</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Using metadata from AI2-THOR combined with SAM masks:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>def get_spatial_context(controller, target_mask):
    """
    Uses AI2-THOR metadata + instance segmentation
    to determine which object the target is on or inside.
    """
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Beyond simply finding what object matches the query, we also want to know where it is in the scene and whether it is on another object or on something else. Thus, to do so, we combine</p>

<ol>
  <li>SAM’s pixel level mask for the target object.</li>
  <li>Ai2-THOR’s instance segmentation, telling us which object each pixel belongs to.</li>
</ol>

<p>We thus implement a helper function called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get_spatial_context(controller, target_mask)</code> that allows us to</p>

<ol>
  <li>Read the latest event from the controller</li>
  <li>Extract pixels inside the SAM mask</li>
  <li>Map RGB colors to a Thor object ID</li>
  <li>Lookup the object metadata and parentReceptacles.</li>
</ol>

<p>Intuitiviely, the SAM mask tells us which pixels are part of the target, the instance segmentation frame tells us which simulator object those pixels correspond to, and the metadata tells us what the object is residing on, such as a table, couch, drawer, etc. We can then use this location string to extract spatial context and better understand the locations of objects relative to our target object in the environment.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="navigating-the-environment">Navigating the Environment</h2>

<p>By providing the system with a natural language query, such as “find the blue cup”, our model will decipher this message into a query that determines searching for a cup, in which afterwards RoboTHOR will explore the scene until the target is visible, in which we then can run our SAM / sliding window CLIP to find the object. We have two methods of navigation, one which relies on an existing API and another which uses a heuristic to calculate distance.</p>

<p>GetShortestPath.</p>

<ol>
  <li>By using <a href="https://ai2thor.allenai.org/robothor/documentation/#sub-shortest-path">GetShortestPath</a> with the AI2-THOR, we can feed parameters of the object type we are looking for, such as cup, our current position, and the allowed error. If the object exists and is achievable, then we can get the path event from the start to the end object. One limitation of our API is that it is unable to distinguish between two objects, thus if a query supplies “apple” and there exist two apples on the simulation, it will naturally navigate to the closest one. GetShortestPath provides us with the corner paths on the path, so by setting them as waypoints, our robot can follow the action until it reaches the desired object.</li>
</ol>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>from ai2thor.util.metrics import (
    get_shortest_path_to_object_type
)

path = get_shortest_path_to_object_type(
   controller=controller,
    object_type="Apple",
    initial_position=dict(
        x=0,
        y=0.9,
        z=0.25
    )
)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If our navigation does not work, then we perform random navigation, in which we consider four different directions (left, right, forward, backwards), and essentially like a maze, follow the right side of the wall until we reach the desired object. We may also perform a full rotation, and if it fails to reveal the object, it can move until it finds a new vantage point.</p>

<p>If the object does not exist, and if repeated movement patterns fail to detect the object, then the system concludes that the object is not in the scene and will report failure. This failsure ensures that our algorithm doesn’t infinitely search forever.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="experiments-and-findings">Experiments and Findings</h2>
<p>We evaluated our pipeline in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FloorPlan_Train1_3</code> scene of AI2-THOR to test the integration of our navigation and vision systems. In our primary test case, the agent was tasked with the query “Find the laptop.” At the initial state in the center of the room, the global frame score for the laptop was low at 0.262, correctly indicating that the object was likely far away or small. The Smart Nav module successfully generated a path with one waypoint to the appropriate coordinates, which effectively brought the agent to the correct location.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the destination, the vision pipeline triggered and SAM generated 32 candidate masks for the scene. CLIP scored the best crop with a confidence of 0.346, which was sufficient to distinguish the laptop from the table and background noise. The system successfully resolved the context, identifying that the target was located at a specific receptacle ID and confirming the relationship “Laptop on Surface.”</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Starting Active Search for: laptop

<p><em>Fig 4. Example of laptop detected by SAM, with bounding box and accuracy prediction.</em></p>

<p>We also observed that raw CLIP thresholds can be noisy, so we implemented a dynamic confidence threshold of 0.23. Scores below this are treated as noise, prompting the agent to rotate or move away rather than hallucinating a detection. This combination of heuristic navigation and threshold-based verification resulted in a robust agent capable of locating objects without prior training on the specific environment.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="additional-search-experiments-and-failure-analysis">Additional Search Experiments and Failure Analysis</h2>

<p>To rigorously test the generalization capabilities of our agent, we conducted a series of experiments on a diverse set of objects including a cup, chair, book, microwave, and apple. These tests revealed specific strengths in our hybrid navigation approach as well as distinct challenges regarding object scale and confidence thresholds.</p>

<p>The search for the “Chair” highlighted a critical limitation in the simulator’s metadata-based navigation API, which threw an ambiguity error because multiple (5) chairs existed in the scene. However, once the “Smart Nav” crashed, the agent automatically switched to visual exploration. By wandering the room and applying the sliding window CLIP mechanism, the agent successfully located a chair with a high confidence score of 0.279.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>============================================================

<p><em>Fig 5. Example of chair detected, after switching to visual navigation</em></p>

<p>Similarly, the “Microwave” was not present in the scene’s metadata list, yet the visual system autonomously located it with a score of 0.261. These instances validate that our system is capable of “open-world” discovery and does not strictly rely on the simulator’s internal ground truth to function.</p>

<p>Conversely, the experiments with small objects like “Cup” and “Apple” illustrated the delicate balance of confidence thresholding. In the case of the cup, the agent navigated near the target, but the global clip score hovered around 0.16. The sliding window fallback detected a potential candidate with a score of 0.219. However, because our system enforces a strict confidence threshold of 0.23 to prevent hallucinations, this detection was rejected, and the agent reported a failure. A similar situation occurred with the apple; the agent arrived at the correct location, but the visual verification score of 0.146 was deemed too low. These false negatives demonstrate that while our high threshold ensures high precision, it reduces recall for small or partially occluded objects that occupy few pixels in the frame. Future improvements would involve implementing a dynamic threshold that scales based on the expected size of the target object relative to the camera’s field of view.</p>

<p>Finally, the “Book” experiment demonstrated the system’s resilience to navigation errors. During this trial, the “Smart Nav” heuristic generated a valid path but timed out before reaching the final waypoint. Despite the mechanical failure, the visual perception loop remained active. As the agent drifted during the timeout, the visual scanner identified the book with a score of 0.265. This confirms that decoupling the vision pipeline from the navigation logic creates a more robust system, where a failure in path planning does not necessarily result in a failure to perceive the environment.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this project, we presented an end-to-end robot navigation system that integrates modern foundation vision models with embodied AI simulation to enable object-centric perception, reasoning, and navigation. By combining SAM for class-agnostic instance segmentation and CLIP for open-vocabulary semantic matching, our system is able to robustly identify target objects in cluttered, realistic indoor environments without relying on predefined object categories or task-specific retraining.</p>

<p>A key strength of our approach lies in the decoupling of spatial localization and semantic understanding. SAM provides precise pixel-level object boundaries, while CLIP assigns semantic meaning to each candidate region using natural language queries. This modular design allows the agent to generalize to unseen objects, handle partial occlusions, and adapt to diverse viewpoints, challenges that are common in embodied settings but difficult for traditional closed-set perception systems. Furthermore, by computing CLIP similarity over cropped segmentation masks rather than full images, we reduce background bias and improve robustness in visually complex scenes.</p>

<p>Beyond object detection, we extend perception to spatial relationship reasoning by leveraging AI2-THOR metadata in conjunction with SAM masks. This enables the agent to infer relations such as whether an object is on, inside, or supported by another object, allowing richer scene understanding beyond simple target localization. These spatial cues can be visualized and used to inform navigation decisions, bridging perception and action in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>Our navigation strategy combines simulator-provided shortest-path planning with heuristic exploration and closed-loop perception. This allows the agent to actively reposition itself when initial detections are ambiguous or incomplete, demonstrating the importance of embodied interaction for reliable visual understanding. When the target object is not present, the system terminates gracefully rather than searching indefinitely, ensuring practical behavior in failure cases.</p>

<p>Overall, this project demonstrates how foundation models like CLIP and SAM can be effectively integrated into an embodied AI pipeline to enable flexible, generalizable robot navigation driven by natural language commands. Future work could explore tighter integration between perception and control, multi-step language instructions, memory-based exploration, or learning-based navigation policies that further exploit the rich semantic and spatial representations provided by these models.</p>

<h3 id="image">Image</h3>
<p>Please create a folder with the name of your team id under /assets/images/, put all your images into the folder and reference the images in your main content.</p>

<p style="width: 400px; max-width: 100%;">You can add an image to your survey like this:
<img src="/CS163-Projects-2025Fall/assets/images/UCLAdeepvision/object_detection.png" alt="YOLO" /></p>
<p><em>Fig 1. YOLO: An object detection method in computer vision</em> [1].</p>

<p>Please cite the image if it is taken from other people’s work.</p>

<h3 id="table">Table</h3>
<p>Here is an example for creating tables, including alignment syntax.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left"> </th>
      <th style="text-align: center">column 1</th>
      <th style="text-align: right">column 2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">row1</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Text</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">Text</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">row2</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Text</td>
      <td style="text-align: right">Text</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="code-block">Code Block</h3>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># This is a sample code block
import torch
print (torch.__version__)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="formula">Formula</h3>
<p>Please use latex to generate formulas, such as:</p>

\[\tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t)}_i = \frac{\alpha \tilde{\mathbf{z}}^{(t-1)}_i + (1-\alpha) \mathbf{z}_i}{1-\alpha^t}\]

<p>or you can write in-text formula \(y = wx + b\).</p>

<h3 id="more-markdown-syntax">More Markdown Syntax</h3>
<p>You can find more Markdown syntax at <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">this page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="reference">Reference</h2>
