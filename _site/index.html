        <blockquote>
  <p>Vision-based learning has become a central paradigm for enabling robots to operate in complex, unstructured environments. Rather than relying on hand-engineered perception pipelines or task-specific supervision, recent work increasingly leverages large-scale video data to learn transferable visual representations and predictive models for control. This survey reviews a sequence of recent approaches that illustrate this progression: learning control directly from video demonstrations, pretraining universal visual representations, incorporating predictive dynamics through visual point tracking, and augmenting learning with synthetic visual data. Together, these works highlight how representation learning and prediction from video are enabling increasingly generalizable robot manipulation capabilities.</p>

  <p>Super-resolution has long faced a fundamental tension: the highest-quality models require billions of operations, while edge devices demand sub-100ms inference. This article examines three recent methods—SPAN, EFDN, and DSCLoRa—that challenge this tradeoff through architectural innovation, training-time tricks, and efficient adaptation. We’ll see how rethinking the upsampling operation, leveraging structural reparameterization, and applying low-rank decomposition can each dramatically improve efficiency without sacrificing output quality.</p>

This project presents a diagnostic-driven framework for understanding segmentation failures on Cityscapes and introduces a SAM3-guided boundary supervision method that injects geometric priors into SegFormer. By combining cross-model difficulty analysis with geometry-aware auxiliary training, we demonstrate targeted improvements on thin and boundary-sensitive classes without increasing inference cost.</p>

        <blockquote>
  <p>Facial Recognition (FR) systems are being increasingly used in high stake environments, but their decision making processes remain a mystery, raising concerns regarding trust, bias, and robustness. Traditional methods such as occlusion sensitivity or saliency maps (e.g., Grad-CAM), often fail to capture the causal mechanisms driving verification decisions or diagnosis reliance on shortcuts. This report analyzes three modern paradigms that shift Explainable AI (XAI) from passive visualization to active, feature level interrogation. We examined FastDiME [5] which utilizes generative diffusion models to create counterfactuals for detecting shortcut learning, Feature Guided Gradient Backpropagation (FGGB) [3], which mitigates vanishing gradients to produce similarity and dissimilarity maps, and Frequency Domain Explainability [2], which introduces Frequency Heat Plots (FHPs) to diagnose biases in CNNs. By synthesizing these approaches, we examine how modern XAI tools can assess model reliance on noise versus structural identity, with the goal of offering a pathway toward more robust and transparent biometric systems.</p>

  <p>[Project Track: Project 1] Deep learning has become a standard tool for dense prediction in environmental monitoring. Inthis project, we focus on semantic segmentation of coral reef imagery using the CoralScapes dataset. Starting from a pretrained SegFormer-B5 model, we design a coral-specific training pipeline that combines tiling, augmentations, and a CE+Dice loss. This yields a modest but consistent improvement in mIoU and qualitative boundary sharpness over the original checkpoint. We also run exploratory experiments with DeepLabv3 and SAM3, and discuss practical limitations due to the absence of coral-specific pretraining and limited compute.</p>

        <blockquote>
  <p>Human pose estimation is a fundamental problem in computer vision that focuses on localizing and identifying key body joints, such as elbows, knees, wrists, and shoulders of a person through images or video. By predicting these keypoints or predefined body landmarks, models can infer a structured, skeleton-like representation of the human body, which enables further exploration into understanding human posture, motion, and interactions with the environment. As such, this field is a crucial area of research that is used in various real-world applications like action recognition or healthcare. In this project, we study a variety of different deep learning approaches to 2D human pose estimation, beginning first with early end-to-end regression models and progressing towards more structured and context-aware architectures. In particular, we delve deeper into how modeling choices around global context, spatial precision, and body structure influence pose estimation performances.</p>

  <p>Camera pose estimation is one important component in computer vision used for robotics, AR/VR, 3D reconstruction, and more. It involves determining the camera’s 3D position and orientation, also known as the “pose” in various environments and scenes. PoseNet, MeNet, and JOG3R are all various deep learning techniques used to accomplish camera pose estimation. There are also sensor-based tracking like LEDs and particle filters. We focus on geometric methods, specifically Structure-from-Motion (SfM).</p>

        <blockquote>
  <p>[Project Track] Street-level semantic segmentation is a core capability for autonomous driving systems, yet performance is often dominated by severe class imbalance where large categories such as roads and skies overwhelm safety-critical but rare classes like bikes, motorcycles, and poles. Using the BDD100K dataset, this study systematically examines how architectural choices, loss design, and training strategies affect segmentation quality beyond misleading pixel-level accuracy. Starting from a DeepLabV3-ResNet50 baseline, we demonstrate that high pixel accuracy (~ 94%) can coincide with extremely poor mIoU (~ 4%) under imbalance. We then introduce class-weighted and combined Dice-Cross-Entropy/Focal losses, auxiliary supervision, differential learning rates, and gradient clipping, achieving a 10x improvement in mIoU. Then, we propose a targeted optimization strategy that remaps the task to six safety-critical small classes and leverages higher resolution, aggressive augmentation, and boosted class weights for thin and small objects. This approach significantly improves IoU for bicycles, motorcycles, and poles, highlighting practical trade-offs between accuracy, resolution, and computational cost. However, such increases in resolution resulted in significant increases to training time per epoch, resulting in less training. Our last contribution is a boundary-aware auxillary supervision strategy that explicitly promotes boundary preservation for thin and small objects while maintaining architectural simplicity. Overall, the work provides an empirically grounded blueprint for addressing class imbalance and small-object segmentation in urban scene understanding.</p>

        <blockquote>
  <p>Image geolocation—the task of predicting geographic coordinates from visual content alone—has evolved significantly with advances in deep learning. This survey examines four landmark approaches that have shaped the field. We begin with PlaNet (2016), which pioneered the geocell classification framework using CNNs and adaptive spatial partitioning based on photo density. We then explore TransLocator (2022), which leverages Vision Transformers and semantic segmentation maps to capture global context and improve robustness across varying conditions. Next, we analyze PIGEON (2023), which introduces semantic geocells respecting administrative boundaries, Haversine smoothing loss to penalize geographically distant predictions less harshly, and CLIP-based pre-training to achieve human-competitive performance on GeoGuessr. Finally, we examine ETHAN (2024), a prompting framework that applies chain-of-thought reasoning to large vision-language models, enabling interpretable geographic deduction without task-specific training. Through this progression, we trace the architectural evolution from convolutional networks to transformers to foundation models, highlighting key innovations in spatial partitioning strategies, loss function design, and the integration of semantic reasoning for worldwide image localization.</p>
